title: 'Cl√©ment Renaud\''s answer to Why was the Renaissance created? - Quora'
---

The Renaissance was created by historians as a concept to express
phenomenons seen mainly in art, religion and politics that were
happening in Europe between the 14th and 17th century. It encompass a
lot of different experiences in time and places from the Italian
Quattrocento and the invention of the perspective in painting to the
political foundation of humanism that will lead to new democratic
regimes in the later 18th century.

The whole idea of Renaissance (it means "rebirth" in French) was created
by historians to define a vast period of transition and change in the
history of Europe spanning over centuries.

About the why, historians do invent words for epochs so it makes it
easier to discuss, compare and analyze what happened at different
periods of human history.
