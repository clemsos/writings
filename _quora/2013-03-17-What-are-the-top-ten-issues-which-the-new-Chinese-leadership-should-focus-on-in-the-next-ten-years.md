    Clément Renaud\'s answer to What are the top ten issues which the new
    Chinese leadership should focus on in the next ten years? - Quora
---

-   **Education system** : reform Gaokao, try to deliver more actual
    skills to students, not only paper diploma. Build long-term
    relationships and exchange programs instead. Stop to conceive
    universities based on their real estate value.
-   **Law enforcement**, more specifically to address all industrial
    issues that actually lead to pollution,  workers exploitation,
    unsafe products\...

<!-- -->

-   **Urbanization** **and development gap between provinces** : Apart
    better water supplies for the North and hundred of millions of
    housing, a new administrative organization for new comers is needed
    as the actual hukou is a pain for the whole country and contribute
    to inequality and hate between people from different regions.
-   **Agricultural** : modernize and automatize to reach better
    efficiency as countryside is going to be quite empty soon.
-   **Media influence**: current cultural image worldwide is based only
    on communism and Chinese millenary history background - and
    therefore is quite unaccessible to non-Chinese
-   **CCP and military modernization** : manage modernization of the
    Parti without having to enter a war with Japan to clean the Party
    and get military happy. Update discourse and attitude about its
    neighbors so China can gain respect and good influence in Asia, not
    only business domination.
-   **Growing prices :** as housing is already unaffordable for most
    Chinese in tier one cities - and still growing, government will have
    to cope with top Chinese cities entering the club of the most
    expensive places in the world, and the gap it will create with other
    cities and villages in China.
-   **Generation clash** : China\'s elder population will be soon a vast
    majority with only their unique son or daughter to sustain them. It
    will be both a problem of resources and culture. The differences
    between post 80s young adults and their parents who grew up during
    the cultural revolution, added to financial stress due to the
    absence of retirement fees will be very complicated to handle on
    micro (family) and macro (country) level
-   **Pressure** **for historical debate** : If some recent cultural
    trends shows that people are less and less interested in the soldier
    Lei Feng and the mythical version of the cultural revolution, it
    seems like there is much more ongoing discussion about what has
    really happen during that time than it was few years ago. Even
    public figures like Feng Xiaogang or Mo Yan have recently called to
    the parti for a reopening of discussions on that topic.
-   **Foreigners coming :** from Europe and the USA but also from Africa
    and South Asia. It means people coming to work but as well people
    coming to invest, and therefore may needs guaranty and protection to
    stay.
