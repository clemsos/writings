title: 'What\''s so great about Baidu?'
---

From a user perspective :\

-   It is by far the best option to find any practical answer about
    something that is in China. About politics / history do check
    <http://google.co.hk> though ;)
-   It is 10 times faster and 100 times more reliable than Google within
    mainland China (Google works less than 1/3 of a time recently)
-   The Baidu groups [百度知道](http://zhidao.baidu.com) are a golden
    mine for tips that makes one\'s life  easier : recipes, opening
    hours, transportation, etc.
-   Baidu Groups will even provide you with things like direct download
    links for softwares and activation keys - for outlaws only, of
    course.
-   You can find entire movies and TV serials just by looking up their
    names on Baidu Video
-   A lot of free music on Baidu Music as well, with links to direct
    download from deep web FTP scanning. They even provide a desktop
    player [千千静听](http://ttplayer.qianqian.com/) with the lyrics for
    a karaoke training at home.
-   The search engine can be used as a dictionary as it offers directly
    Chinese translation for any English word you look up
-   It is the most crappy search engine ever when it comes to find
    something in a Western language
-   As [**Ajeet Gupta**](http://quora.com/profile/Ajeet-Gupta-1) said,
    Baidu is absolutely ubiquitous on the Chinese Web. You can do
    everything from browsing to paying using Baidu\'s products. Just
    have a look at Baidu\'s product list :
    [百度产品大全](http://www.baidu.com/more/)
-   Their Chinese language input system for Android is just great
