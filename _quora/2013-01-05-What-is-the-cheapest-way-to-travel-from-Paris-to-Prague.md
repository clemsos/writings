    Paris to Prague? - Quora

You should try the bus with Eurolines, usually the cheapest way to
travel around Europe for a fair price.

Avoid train which is crazy expensive in Europe. Check planes like other
posts suggest ([skyscanner.com](http://skyscanner.com) , Easy Jet, etc.)
. You can also try to share a car via French websites like
[covoiturage.fr](http://covoiturage.fr) or [karzoo.eu](http://karzoo.eu)
