    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to I heard you can get a PhD in UK in 3 years.

Yes, average duration of a phD in Europe is 3 years in most disciplines
(EU standards).\

More theoretical fields like philosophy and social sciences accept more
but you still need special administrative dispensation to pursue in 4th
or 5th year.
