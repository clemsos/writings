    I heard you can get a PhD in UK in 3 years. Can you do the same at
    Spain, France, Italy, etc?

Yes, average duration of a phD in Europe is 3 years in most disciplines
(EU standards).\
\
More theoretical fields like philosophy and social sciences accept more
but you still need special administrative dispensation to pursue in 4th
or 5th year.
