    How does promotion work within the Chinese
    Communist party? - Quora
---

To rise within the Communist party is a lifelong process and the
preparation starts at a very early age. You need a continued career path
from the kindergarden to the highest spheres.\
\
The typical CCP career involves becoming gradually a leader (*zhang,*
长) of higher rank. In middle school, you really want to be the head of
your sport or math team (队长) and the lead of your class (班长). Your
parents will push you very hard to become also a school representative
(会长). From there, you will be invited to different meetings and groups
with other kids, also going to special summer schools where you can meet
with the head of the district (区长) or local mayor (市长).\
\
You will be in charge to solve conflicts in your class. Actually, at
that point you have already more power than the teacher, esp if you come
from a well-known family. If you think the teacher \"behaves badly\",
you can just report him and he will put in a very difficult situation.\
\
After 4-6 years of a (top) university, you will start to make your way
slowly to province and national government to become a ministry (部长).
Here you have two main options:\

1.  internal promotion : get to Beijing and obtain an important position
    inside the party ecosystem there. Grow the ladder of the Party
    administration by expanding your influence (what Xi Jinping did)
2.  be successful in a key area : A typical career will involve top
    management position in an important national company or higher
    education in a first or second-tier city. Quora User has mentioned
    that engineers were usually preferred - he\'s right but I think it
    is changing quickly. Most of the key cities are already built so
    current big issues for local governments often require more
    management and less building.

Your best asset for both choices will be your network, starting with
your univ friends that are the first important group you can rely on.
Actually, the first choice (internal promotion) will be impossible to
make if you didn\'t attend Qinhua or maybe Beida University in Beijing.\
\
After some years, when you have got enough power and connections
nation-wide, you may be nominated by some of your (elder) peers to
attend some important position in the central government.\
\
The whole point of this answer is : there is no newcomer in the CCP.
Nobody really \"join\" the party and get promoted. In that sense, it is
really not similar to big corporations, like other answers suggested.
Instead, you are raised with it and get promoted during your lifetime.\
\
The word *zhang* 长 doesn\'t only mean \"*to be a leader*\". It also
mean \"*to grow*\" and \"*to last*\" because all three things are
actually so close in China.
