    Is the expression \'bonjour mon ami\' still
    used in France? - Quora

Calling each other \"mon ami\" is not very common today,Â  but I may use
it with some very close friend. It is quite formal and dated tough, but
sometimes you want that kind of feeling, to emphasize that we are like
family. A more informal way which I like is \"bonjour mon vieux\".
