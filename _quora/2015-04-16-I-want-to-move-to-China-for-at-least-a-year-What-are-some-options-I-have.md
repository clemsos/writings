    I want to move to China for at least a year. What are some options I
    have?

I will follow other advices on  enroling a university to learn Chinese.
Plus, try to avoid Bejing and Shanghai. You can move there later if you
really want to make a career in China\
To start in China, just go in 2nd 3rd tier cities. Life will be cheaper
and you will learn more, both language and about the country. Places
like Chengdu, Wuhan or Chongqing are really nice.
