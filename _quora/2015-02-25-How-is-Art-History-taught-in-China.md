title: 'Cl√©ment Renaud\''s answer to How is Art History taught in China?'
---

As [Guo Wei](http://quora.com/profile/Guo-Wei-6) mentioned, History of
Art is not taught in middle school. The specialization in art for the
final examination in high school (gaokao) has some history of art. Most
of it is taught through reproduction of famous drawings and paintings.
Depending on teachers, it can be mostly Western Renaissance or 19th
century. Impressionism is often taught quite extensively. The general
approach is more about the history and evolution of technics than
movement and biographies. Artists from the 20th century and more
abstract painting are often not even mentioned. A few years before,
there were very few courses about Chinese traditional painting but I
heard this has been changing recently.\
Students usually know more than what they have been taught in school
because they spend long hours in libraries and bookshops for their exams
