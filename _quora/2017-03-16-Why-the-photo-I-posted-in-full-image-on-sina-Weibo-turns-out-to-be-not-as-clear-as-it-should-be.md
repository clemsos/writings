    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Why the photo I posted in full image on sina

To avoid large images (especially photos from mobiles), most websites
will resize your image on-the-fly when you post it.

The idea is that they don't want to store and force users to download
large images (usually \<500k) so they modify it to have an appropriate
size (likely \>200k). That is why quality appear downgraded once you
have uploaded it.

It is not specific to Weibo, most websites do that
