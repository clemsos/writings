    ClÃ©ment Renaud\'s answer to Are the comparisons of Hitler and Trump
    valid? - Quora
---

Historical comparisons are useful to identify and reflect on similar
patterns and strategies in our history. They are valid as long as they
don't try to imply that things are equals.

On the topic of comparing Hitler and Trump, I warmly recommend you to
read this (long) article in the *Los Angeles Review of Books* by Ron
Rosenbaum, one of Hitler's biographers.

On a sidenote, I have no idea how someone can claim that Trump has "very
little ideology". Please check his books \[2\] and let me know if you
see any absence of ideology \[3\] in it.
