By himself.

As a teacher, you have to provide guidance and knowledge but learning is
something that can only happen by investing personal time and energy.
Even in a group setup, the learning is happening for each individual
differently. You get some information during class or watching video but
if you want to learn, you have to rehearse and practice on your own.
Learning is not magic and does not happen only by exposure.
