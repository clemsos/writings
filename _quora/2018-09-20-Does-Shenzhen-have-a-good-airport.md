title: 'Does Shenzhen have a good airport?'

One of my favorite. Brand new, spacious, with very good services and
stunning architecture. The only thing is that despite being an
international airport, most of the flights connect to other places in
China or Eastern Asia. If you want to fly worldwide, you can reach Hong
Kong Airport in an hour by taxi or boat.

The airport was designed as a hub for China which he has become over the
years. Highly recommended
