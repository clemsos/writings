    What designers who have had successful Kickstarter campaigns are based
    in Shenzhen?

Almost all the projects that have been through the Haxlr8r incubator
program in Shenzhen have run successful campaigns on Kickstarter.

Some are not based in Shenzhen though. One of my favorite Shenzhen -
based company is Makeblock, doing educational open source robotics kit.
They are young, fun and have lot of talent. So refreshing to see a 100%
Chinese company with such a good culture.\

Their next product is a drawing robot. It should be going on campaign on
Kickstarter in a few days. I am sure it will be a blast.\
