    Given the same exact text in English and
    Chinese, which would take less time to read? - Quora

It depends on the reader, not the text.\
\
As Fionna said, Chinese and English are read differently by native
readers.\
\
In languages using the latin alphabet, you must read linearly to first
understand words, then sentences and finally a text.  Reading Chinese is
less linear. Words are a combination of images that form the text. You
can skip to only proeminent characters in the picture.\
\
Chinese ancient poetry works like a big picture made of many strokes.
The reading goes in many directions to provide a combination of
meanings. European traditional poetry is about rythm, time, sequence of
sounds. It is usually written to be read from start to end.\
 \
So to answer you question : native readers will instinctively pick the
appropriate way to read through a text and therefore may read faster -
which means read AND properly understand.\
\
For instance, Chinese people may be slower while reading English because
they have to be careful not to miss important words. English people will
be slown down in reading Chinese texts because they are looking at a lot
of useless words instead of seeking only the important ones.\
\
IMHO this is something very hard to learn/unlearn.
