    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What type of web apps is Flask better for,
    and what type of web apps is Django better for? - Quora

Flask is a bit lighter and lower level than Django, so I prefer Flask
for a very minimal or highly custom API while Django is more powerful
for classic CRUD/REST web apps.
