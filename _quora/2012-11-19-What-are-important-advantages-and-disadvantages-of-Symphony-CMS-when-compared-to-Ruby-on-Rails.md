    What are important advantages and
    disadvantages of Symphony CMS when compared to Ruby on Rails?
---

**Basically, Symphony is designed to build websites and Rails to build
web applications.**\
\
Advantages of Symphony CMS over Rails\
\

-   **Deployment** : Symphony CMS use PHP/mySQL so it is pretty cheap
    and easy to find a good hosting solution
-   **User Interface :** The admin dashboard is very clean and
    straightforward, plus it allows you to make some modifications to
    the website online.
-   **Data sources :** As Symphony is based on Xslt, virtually any XML
    feed can be parsed very easily into the website. I use this to
    integrate my Tumblr and other blogs directly into my main layout
-   **Community :** People working on Symphony are very active so the
    forum is a very good place to ask questions and be answered quickly

\
Advantages of Rails over Symphony :\
\

-   **Controllers :** As you build everything from scratch, you have
    better control on the methods to be used with your classes, so you
    can add any specific behavior you like during database IO.
-   **Gem :** Rails has been used for any kind of projects from the
    smallest to the biggest, so you have a lot of libraries that you can
    use directly
-   **Internationalization :** For the same reason, the multi-language
    on Rails is very easy. I run across some problems with Symphony in
    adding multiple languages, but it was one year ago so it should be
    fixed now.
-   **Documentation :** You will find tons of blogs, screencasts, online
    courses about Rails.
-   **Unit testing :** No unit testing for Symphony so far

\
Another thing about Symphony is that you may have to learn XSLT - and
use PHP. The framework outputs very clean and efficient code, but it is
way less convenient to write than Rails.
