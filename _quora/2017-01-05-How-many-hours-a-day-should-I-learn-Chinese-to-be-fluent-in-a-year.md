    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to How many hours a day should I learn Chinese
    to be fluent in a year? - Quora
---

You won't be fluent by the end of a year anyway, but the number of hours
depends if you are in China or not.

If you are China, you will benefit from hundreds of hours of passive
learning during your daily life (hearing people talking, reading signs
in the streets, discussing with neighbors, etc.)

If you are in a non-Chinese speaking area, then you need to find a way
to immerse yourself in the language. My advice : surround yourself with
Chinese speakers. It will help tremendously your learning process, and
may also help you to assess if speaking Chinese is really worth the
1000s of hours you going to spend on it.
