    What is the way to correct the behavior of countries that dig under
    walls and infiltrate by sending spies? Is force the only way for that?

Countries are not people. You don\'t "correct their behavior", you
negociate positions. Plus, the only reason some governments don\'t use
agents to gather intelligence is because their secret services don\'t
have the mean or ability to do so.
