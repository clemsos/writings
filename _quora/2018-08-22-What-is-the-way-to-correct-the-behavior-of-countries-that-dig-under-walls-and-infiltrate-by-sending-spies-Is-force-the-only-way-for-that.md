    What is the way to correct the behavior of
    countries that dig under walls and infiltrate by sending spies? Is force
    the only way for that? - Quora

Countries are not people. You don\'t "correct their behavior", you
negociate positions. Plus, the only reason some governments don\'t use
agents to gather intelligence is because their secret services don\'t
have the mean or ability to do so.
