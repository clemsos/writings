    What is the easiest way to learn Chinese language skills with the least
    effort?
---

Go to China, especially into the Central regions and seek for friends
and fun. They may be some pain imvolved about the language at start but
this is such a unique and rewarding experience that it should soon go
away. Learn with the people you like, that\'s the easiest way.
