    When would Alibaba be able to push through
    the American or European market? - Quora
---

Aliexpress has already been launched in several countries in Europe.
Compared to China, one of the main problem in Europe is the cost of
storage and delivery. Alibaba is experimenting with warehouses that
stored hot items from China. Its main advantage is unsual and cheaper
products coming straight from China. About when, not in foreseeable
future except if something super bad happen to Amazon.
