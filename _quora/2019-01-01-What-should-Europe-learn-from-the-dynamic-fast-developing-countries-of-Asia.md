That you need to let some things go in order to make space for the new.

Not all traditions and building are good to preserve. Plus, to make
everything into "memorial" is not a proper way to face aging.

If you look at many European cities, the focus of development has been
on preserving the old city centres, and grow from there a periphery.

After some years, prices in centres have raised. Lower middle class
households have been pushed out, leaving only tourists and higher
incomes. Peripheries on the other hand often remains unpractical, having
to rely on infrastructures built for the old centres.

Spatial - and therefore social - inequalities keep increasing because
nurturing the old is conceived at the expense of developing the new.

There could have been other ways to design cities. A good example that
is often seen in Asian metropolitan areas is "polycentric" cities, with
different districts with their own centres (old or new) that function
independently from each others.

The problem is that now that cities are built, someone have to decide
how you make space again. This usually takes a violent upheaval. In the
19th century, Haussmann did to Paris roughly what Chinese planners did
to Beijing during the last decade. Destroy most of the city, rebuild it
differently and keep some small parts of the ancient city to tie in some
grant historical narrative.

Europe today has to decide how to reframe its past to provide a way
towards the future. Asia underwent a similar situation in the 20th
century, which lead to enormous human and cultural costs.

Europe could take a good look into Asian experiences to learn how it can
manage to change without reaching such extremes.
