    What do I need to do in order to replicate
    Shenzhen in \<5 years?

I will say you need everything Quora User mentioned, plus another thing
: a Hong Kong, next door.

That is : a giant international merchant city with a huge and active
harbor, a deep-rooted culture of trade, a solid and well-known
international law system, an English-speaking administration, a growing
industrial fabric and, well, a banking system where total secrecy and
tax-free money is totally okay.

By the twisted ways of History, the British opium trade plays a very
important role in the existence of Shenzhen today.
