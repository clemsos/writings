    What is your favorite hotel in Beijing?
---

[Beijing EAST Hotel](http://www.east-beijing.com/en/default.aspx). A
little bit remote from the city center (near 798 Art District) but the
quality of service and prices compensate largely.\
\
It offers great value for money - check the membership card - and the
2nd floor is a nice place to (net)work if you are involved in the art /
design business.
