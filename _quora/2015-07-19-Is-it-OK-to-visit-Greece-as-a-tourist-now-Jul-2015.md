    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Is it OK to visit Greece as a tourist now
    (Jul 2015)? - Quora

Regarding other answers about ATM limitations : it doesn\'t apply to
foreign cards. I am travelling here now and I got cash easily from ATM
several times in Athens during the last 5 days. Same for other people I
know.\

The place is absolutely gorgeous, food is great, people are nice, life
is vibrant and tourists are very welcome.\
Enjoy your stay !
