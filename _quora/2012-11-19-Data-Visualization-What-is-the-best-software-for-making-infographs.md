    Data Visualization: What is the best
    software for making infographs?
---

There is a bunch of good tools & softwares out there to create
infographics and visualization. Here are those I like the most :\
\
**Desktop software :**\
\

-   [**Gephi**](http://gephi.org)** ** for network-related
    visualization. Allows to create nice complex graph from any
    node-edge data.
-   [**The R Project**](http://r-project.org)** ** If you need to really
    manipulate data, R is the language to use for statistics and has
    lots of useful libraries. I advice to use
    [RStudio](http://rstudio.org) to work with a nice IDE though.
-   [**Tableau Software**](http://tableausoftware.com) a very neat
    dashboard to create interactive graphs. It has a free version
    available.

\
**Web-based tools :**\
\

-   [**Datawrapper**](http://datawrapper.de) a very straightforward tool
    to create customizable charts online
-   [**Infogr.am**](http://infogr.am) a nice web interface for charts
    and infographics with ready-to-use templates and online
    hosting/publishing
-   [**Visual.ly**](http://visual.ly/) a great source of inspiration
    that recently adds some quick templates for social media reports\

\
**Developer toolkit :** (those will require you to write code)\

-   [**Processing**](http://processing.org) may be the best place to
    start if you are a designer / new to programming. Processing is a
    visual-first language with a very simple syntax, plus it comes with
    a nice GUI and has many great libraries to achieve almost anything
    you can dream of. The Javascript version
    [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) will make your
    visualization available to use on websites as well.
-   [**d3**](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki) is a powerful
    Javascript library that has already many graphs and viz templates
    that you can hack for your own purposes.\
-   [**Raphaël**](http://raphaeljs.com) is another Javascript library
    that can comes in a handy if you need to draw vector graphics and
    add interactions to it. It has quite good documentation.

If you want to dig deeper,
