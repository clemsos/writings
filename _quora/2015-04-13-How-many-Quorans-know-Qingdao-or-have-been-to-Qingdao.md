    How many Quorans know Qingdao or have been
    to Qingdao?

I agree with Quora User, this is not a serious question.\
\
If you are asking \"Are you familiar with Qingdao?\", then yes. I have
spent lots of time there for work, leisure and family. It is a nice
place, with many tourists in the summer and way too many cars on
average. It may become very important for the movie industry.
