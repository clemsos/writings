    Clément Renaud\'s answer to What\'s an acceptable email signature for a
    startup CEO in Silicon Valley? - Quora

This is a precious resource to find a relevant title for your email
signature  : [Silicon Valley job title generator - on
tumblr.com](http://siliconvalleyjobtitlegenerator.tumblr.com/)\
\
Then also, you should mentioned that you are very busy, on the road or
in some important meetings - so you can just answer \"k\" to all your
emails.
