    What is your first impression when you
    arrive in Shenzhen?
---

The pace of the city is incredibly fast. No one is older than 40 years
old (the city wasn't build before that).

The rare elderly people have trouble moving in this city. Most of them
can not even cross the wide streets because green lights too short for
them.
