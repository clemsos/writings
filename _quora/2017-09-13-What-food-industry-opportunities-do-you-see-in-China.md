    What food industry opportunities do you see
    in China? - Quora
---

Organic food. A simple label will not work (nobody trust this sort of
stuff in China). It will have to provide a straight path from the farm
to the kitchen, like a constant live stream of the products. The demand
for high-end food products is just enormous in Chinese middle-class
today.
