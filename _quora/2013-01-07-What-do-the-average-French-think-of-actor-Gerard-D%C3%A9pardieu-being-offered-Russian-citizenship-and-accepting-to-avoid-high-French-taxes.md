    What do the average French think of actor
    Gerard Dépardieu being offered Russian citizenship, and accepting, to
    avoid high French taxes?
---

This is a scandal that happened already before with other stars in
France, all willing to quit France because of their personal fortune
getting too big (becoming a target for very high taxes).\
\
The fact that the country which offers citizenship to Gérard Depardieu
is Russia doesn\'t really matter for most of French people. It could
have been Belgium, Switzerland or the US. Any French will understand
that a country welcome a guy who is full of cash, plus an international
star.\
\
Now most of French people will think several things :\

1.  **Gérard Depardieu is an asshole** and he lacks of respect for the
    country and the people who first showed, viewed, loved and even
    produced most of his movies (lots of public money in French cinema).
    French audience basically made 99% of Depardieu\'s career.
2.  His act of leaving France to avoid paying taxes when the crisis is
    all around is a complete absence of solidarity and **a pure act of
    selfishness,** typical bourgeois behavior insulting millions of
    people who would love to escape taxes as well. *NB: French are very
    used to this kind behavior from French elite. They mostly don\'t
    give a damn as it happens frequently.*
3.  **Our complete tax and social system is going nowhere**. We can not
    continue like this and face globalization with such a nonsense way
    to drive economy in our country.
4.  Another thing, maybe the most important : **All this big debate
    about Depardieu is just plain useless** and all this media hype just
    prevents from talking about things that really matters i.e. current
    situation in France and Europe and possible solutions.\
    \

\
In a way, Depardieu gives the perfect example of why French social
system is now a (partial) failure: everyone can just take advantage of
it during all his life and screw it all when time comes for him to pay
back. \
\
Even if taxes are unbearably high for most of French people, we all know
they give access to many great things like social welfare, cheap medical
insurance, public hospitals, allowances for unemployed people, early
retirements, etc.  So you will actually hear people in France saying
*\"I am proud to pay taxes\"* because by some aspects such a protective
social system is a unique chance.\
\
Then you will hear a lot of people complaining about taxes being too
high in France - to complain is a national sport in the country. Though,
poorer people or lower/middle-class usually understand and support the
tax system, as they benefit directly from it. They will complain about
taxes being to excessive but it is more likely an habit, motivated by
real economic concern of surviving with 50% of your wage going into
taxes every month.\
\
Then, you have wealthy people who complain (and make a lot of noise like
Depardieu) because they don\'t really understand why they should be
taxes, as they never have any direct personal benefit from it. All their
companies or activities have usually benefit from public funding though,
as almost every initative does in France.\
\
After new election of François Hollande, you could hear in France people
saying in business circles : *\"Now, I am leaving France\"* because
taxes will become too high*.* Many did it. Corporations move to Ireland
where they can do almost tax-free businesses, bankers store their money
in Luxembourg or Switzerland, etc.\
\
As for the core of your question (and this whole Depardieu thing), most
people in France know there is a huge problem with our social system and
we are going to suffer from it. Then most of people also think that to
divide up wealth somehow is a good think and seeing few people
accumulating so much capital without giving anything is just a complete
shame. It just feel right to have the wealthiest people paying for the
poorest one. Stars can scream and slam the door, big money can find it
disgusting, it doesn\'t really change that fact\...
