    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What is the difference between the Yonex
    racket made in China and Japan? - Quora

The Japan one may be the exact same product, but packaged in Japan to be
shipped from there. See [Country of origin -
Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_of_origin)

Another difference: the Japanese one is likely to be more expensive.
