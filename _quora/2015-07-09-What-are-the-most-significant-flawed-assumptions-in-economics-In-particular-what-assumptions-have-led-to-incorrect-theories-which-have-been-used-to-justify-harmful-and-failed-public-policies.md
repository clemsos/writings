    What are the most significant flawed
    assumptions in economics? In particular, what assumptions have led to
    incorrect theories which have been used to justify harmful and failed
    public policies?

The very idea that economics can become an autonomous discipline, as in
a discipline isolated from history, geography and politics.\
\
Economics as a discipline has been trying very hard to get recognition
as a \"real science\" and subsequently came to despise its old pales :
the human sciences. Economists got so focus on flexing their algorithmic
muscles on the stage that they forgot the power of observation : please,
just look at the actual thing before getting to conclusions !\
\
Once at a conference,Â  I have seen this guy explaining the absence of
impact of fluvial traffic on the commerce of a region in Poland by
applying regressive algorithms on some obscure data. Then he shows a map
of the county and they were no rivers nor seas.\
\
I want to add a special mention for all my economists friends that have
to attend so much incredibly boring conference where people debate for
hours on scatterplot methodologies, so they can say basic things like :
\"if we look at history\...\" or \"maybe you should consider talking to
some of the people involved\...\"\
\
There are real economists out there, and they are real fighters !
