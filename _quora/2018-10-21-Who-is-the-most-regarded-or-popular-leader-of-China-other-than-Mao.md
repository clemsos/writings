    Who is the most regarded or popular leader
    of China other than Mao?
---

Depends on generations.

For elder people, Zhou Enlai is the real hero for leading the country
out of war and never indulge in Mao's fantasies.

For those born after the 70s, its Deng Xiaoping. He is the one who lead
the economic reform and open up China to the world.

For the youngest, it may be Xi Jinping even tough his legacy still have
way less to account for than the two others.
