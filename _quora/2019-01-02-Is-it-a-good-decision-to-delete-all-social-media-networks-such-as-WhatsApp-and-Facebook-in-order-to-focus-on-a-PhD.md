No, don't do it.

A better idea will be to decide which account you want to use for your
professional work.

A phD is not only about working hard in your lab all by yourself. You
will have to spend a fair amount of time meeting and interacting with
new people, colleagues and other researchers.

Social media are very useful to keep in touch with people you meet at a
conference for instance. Also you may want to post updates about your
research or events you are taking part.

Finally, the process of doing a phD may make you feel lonely or isolated
as you spend more time alone in your lab. At that point, it feels good
to be able to reach for an old friend or family to have a discussion
about something unrelated.

Instead of dropping your accounts, keep nurturing you social
relationships. They could turn out to be more precious than your phD in
your future life.
