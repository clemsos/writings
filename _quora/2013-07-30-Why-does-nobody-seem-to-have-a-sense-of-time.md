    time? - Quora

The people you met may have some different views on why you should or
should not be on time.\
\
For instance, if it is a business meeting they may want you to wait a
little(even a lot), so you get impatient and eager to quickly finalize a
deal without taking too\
much time to talk about the details\...\
\
Be late can just be another way to be on time for what they want. It is
not just about to be \"on time\". Chinese business men often adopt this
kind of strategic thinking.\
\
Apart from this, I found people are mostly punctual in China
