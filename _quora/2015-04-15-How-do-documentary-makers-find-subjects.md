title: 'How do documentary makers find subjects?'

Your real subject is a story, not a topic really. Documentaries have
characters and settings. They take place in specific contexts. Also
documentaries are pictures. You don\'t look for subjects, you look at
reality and you write about it until you can picture a story in your
mind (or on a tape).\
\
The romantic version is : you read or see something (a person, a fact, a
place, whatever) and become interested. You start to research and read
more, looking for trends. You talk to people, ask questions, maybe make
friends and understand more your topic. You go out on the field as much
as possible. You write about your findings, shoot some footage, look at
it again, take pictures, go to specific places. You observe.\
\
You need to find the right angle. If you just keep shooting around, you
end up with fragments, pretty much like ethnographic footage.This
doesn\'t make a film. You need to make a point but also be anecdotal
enough so people can relate to. There may be years before you have a
real story. Eventually, you come across something or someone that is
worth starting the process of making a documentary. Now, you have the
story. You are up to 2-3 years of filming, cutting, post-production,
promotion in festivals, etc.\
\
This was the more artistic vision, now the other side of the scope : how
it happens in most TV channels. A producer come up with a topic and
order a film. You have to find the story, write a script and start
everything before the deadline. Of course, the easiest way is to
fabricate a story : some people crying (pathos), some guns (for the
males), some love (sex maybe?) and some heroes. If you can have
explosions or some violence, that\'s great. You reach the deadline on a
small budget (actors aren\'t paid), you have a huge audience crying and
loving it and they ask for more.\
\
Now, what you are really looking for are stories, not subjects. You can
find subjects all around you. Depardon\'s works are exemplary in this
regard : emergency workers, psychiatric hospitals, farmers, cows, etc.
Even your grandma\'s life is possibly a great topic. But what you are
looking for are stories and pictures. Making documentaries is a craft.
How can I turn the boring life of this worker into great pictures ? How
can I not lie ? How can make my point without twisting the reality ?
Which story will allow me to do all this together ? Seeking answers to
those questions may get you on the way.
