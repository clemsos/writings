    How can I draw a 3d sphere with texture,
    like a football ball, using JavaScript?

You should check [three.js, a Javascript 3D
library](http://threejs.org/).\
\
Here are some basic [3D
shapes](http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Shapes.html) and a tutorial
for [applying textures on a sphere in
Three.js](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/09/16/how-to-make-the-earth-in-webgl/).
