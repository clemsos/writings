    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What are white-label products in
    manufacturing? - Quora
---

White-label products are products that get out of the factory without a
brand.

If you go to wholesale markets in China, you can find many products with
no brand for a minimal price. You can then resell them directly or talk
to the factory to add your own brand.

An example is the mobile phone brand Wiko. Two French guys went to
Shenzhen and discovered that they could source very cheap white label
mobiles. Back then, the French market lacked of middle entry phones.
They bought the no-brand phones and just rebranded them under the name
Wiko. Three years later, they were the second most sold items in France.
Today, they are leading in many different countries in Africa and Middle
East as well.

The funny part of this story is that the company were ultimately bought
by the phone manufacturer. So the factory went from producing whitelabel
to owning its own successful brand. A good example that there is many
way to develop products and brands.
