    How many people can I easily communicate with if I know English,
    Russian, France French, and Mandarin?

You\'re looking at it the wrong way. For instance, with French you could
also talk to a lot of people in Northern and Western Africa. The real
question is : where are you going to meet them ? What will you talk
about ? I speak English, French, Chinese, some German and Italian and I
can assure you that the real question still : who are the people I am
interested in talking to \-- and who are willing to talk to me ? Where
are they ? How can I find them ?\
\
Even if you learn a thousand languages, it won\'t actually increase
dramatically the number of people you can talk to. It will increase
their diversity. To learn a language is mostly to learn a culture , and
it takes a lot of curiosity. Then it takes a lot of time to meet people
you can actually talk with. The process of learning a new language is
long and can be painful. Only the people you\'ll meet   will make it
worth it.\

Don\'t count, just make new friends and enjoy !
