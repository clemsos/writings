    Why haven\'t terrorist attacks happened in
    Germany, Italy, Spain, England or Northern European countries but keep
    happening in France?
---

One of the main reason is that when you hit France, you got free
world-class media coverage for weeks which helps a lot to 1) spread
terror (your goal as a terrorist) , 2) demonstrate your strength
globally and 3) raise interest and ideas in the mind of new recruits or
other potential attackers. So far this media strategy is 100% efficient
with every attack in France being subject to an incredible amount of
media attention.

It is true that there is a bigger Muslim community in France but really,
most are peaceful, and the radical ones belonging to terrorist groups
could aim at anywhere else on the planet. As Raul Castro showed in his
answer, there have been attacks in many of the countries you named, not
even mentioning Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, etc.

France is a big symbol with an enormous media echo chamber, so attacking
France is super efficient in bringing terror and destabilizing the
relative peace state in the West.
