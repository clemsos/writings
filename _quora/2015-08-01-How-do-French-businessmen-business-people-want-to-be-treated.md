    How do French businessmen (business people)
    want to be treated?
---

Be straightforward and emphasize the quality of your relationship over
the velocity to close or execute a deal. French people like to take
their time, so don\'t be pushy. Call at business hours and don\'t expect
meetings on weekends. Work and private life are 2 separate things,
equally important - so your urgent email is actually as important as a
coffee with my old pale. Another consequence is that, except if we have
an exceptionally good relationship from day one, I may never discuss my
family matters with you. It is OK tough\

Pro-tip : Learn a thing or two about the region of your client.Â  Food,
soccer, anything\... people tends to love to discuss about their
hometown.
