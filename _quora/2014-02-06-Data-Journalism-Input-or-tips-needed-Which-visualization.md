    Clément Renaud\'s answer to Data Journalism: Input or tips needed: Which
    visualization? - Quora
---

As mentioned below by [Matt Lutze](http://quora.com/profile/Matt-Lutze),
d3  is a very good option.\
\
Once you have formatted your data properly, you can use
[Raw](http://raw.densitydesign.org/) to put together a visualization and
share it on the web. Raw is an online wrapper to d3.js developed by
[Density Design](http://www.densitydesign.org/) in Polytechnic
University of Milano. It is free and very handy.\
\
Your data should be in csv, coma-separated.\
A dataset showing relationship is available on the Raw website. Data
structure seems quite similar to what you are working with :\

> Cocktail,Parts,Ingredient\
> Bloody Mary,9,vodka\
> Bloody Mary,18,Tomato juice\
> Bloody Mary,3,lemon juice\
> Gin and Tonic,12,Gin\
> Gin and Tonic,29,Tonic Water\
> Screwdriver,10,vodka\
> Screwdriver,20,orange juice\

Good luck !
