    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What do French people think about Indians
    who are studying and working in France? - Quora

For the most part, they don't think about them at all.

There are not much preconceived ideas specific to Indians in France,
really. That is due to the fact that French barely see any Indians in
their city. Indians are one of the multiple communities that lives here,
with their own habits and customs. They go quite unnoticed and never
make the news so most people just don't pay any particular attention to
them.
