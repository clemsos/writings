    Why are Google and Facebook banned in China?
    If Google is banned, then how do Chinese phones have Android? - Quora
---

Google and Facebook are banned so it give space to local players like
Sina, Baidu and Tencent to develop into billion dollars companies. Also,
the government can keep better control of the information that
circulates and easily monitor user data as they have full control on
China-based services.\

About Android, China is actually lost to Google as the Google Play
market is closed. All Chinese phone brands ship with Android \*without\*
Google, like Xiaomi that use a fork called MiUI. So Google makes zero
revenue from ads or apps on Android in China. In many cases, you have to
flash the phone to enable Google apps. They are many other different app
markets available in China and constructors usually pay themselves with
it. Android still used as the main OS because it is free and easy to
implement esp since it comes with full ARM support.
