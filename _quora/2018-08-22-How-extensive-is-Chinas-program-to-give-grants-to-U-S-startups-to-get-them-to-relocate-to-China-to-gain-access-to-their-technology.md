    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to How extensive is China\'s program to give
    grants to U.S. startups to get them to relocate to China to gain access
    to their technology? - Quora

As @[Joseph Wang](http://quora.com/profile/Joseph-Wang-9) mentioned,
this is lots of paperwork and dealing with Chinese administration. It
will help you get access to people in local administration, which is a
non negligible factor while doing business in China.

Mostly, these kind of grants seems to be targeted towards Chinese people
that have started tech companies in the US and are willing to move part
or all of their activities back to China. I know of a similar case in
France (blockchain uni research spinoff). Most support for grant
allocation went through the Chinese Academy of Sciences because one team
leader was previously a researcher there.
