    Has the rise of the gig economy contributed
    to greater wealth disparity and inequality as Thomas Piketty suggests in
    this chart? - Quora
---

Piketty's chart itself suggests nothing about the gig economy.
Nevertheless, the recent fragmentation of the labor market can be
understood as a result of increasing wealth disparity.

The concentration of assets has put the main distribution system of
wealth (companies and employment) under stress, resulting in a scarcity
of available resources. When a system is attacked, it usually fragments
to recreate a new stable structure. The boss-employee relationship was
failing at providing stability, so people started to opt out and are now
inventing new work models that can decrease imbalance and reverse
extreme concentration.
