    What are your predictions for China\'s
    economy in 2019?
---

The difficulty to predict what is going to happen in 2019 in China shows
that we have entered very uncertain times.

The economic outlook of the coming year depends on how political
tensions will resolve, both internally and globally.

The national Chinese economy itself has some problems but they are
reasonably under control. Chinese people are working hard. The strategic
industrial planning looks good. Businesses still flourish, even if many
of the craziest opportunities are beyond already.

The main question is politics.

The relationships with the US is of course one of the most decisive
factor. This has been framed as a "trade war" but it looks much more
like a classical political conflict. Xi and Trump are playing the
nationalism card to cover up for internal issues.

Both are having pressing problems within their own country and are
trying to gain time by waging war. Trump is under federal investigation.
Xi is pressured by its own party to pass down leadership. Time is
playing against them.

Both leaders of the two most powerful countries are in unstable
positions. This is not very good, to say the least. That could lead them
to prefer short-sighted decision based on their own political survival
to longer term investment in economic stability and global prosperity.

There is many ways this could ultimately unfold and I won\'t risk
pronostics here.

Still, I am amazed that, after thousands of years, we humans have not
been capable to figure out better ways to rule the planet than what
currently exist.
