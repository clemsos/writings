    Clément Renaud\'s answer to What are some movies with easy to understand
    Mandarin Chinese? - Quora

If you want to use original material to teach Chinese, I will advice
that you look into Chinese New Year movies (贺岁片). As they are mean to
be very popular and largely diffused, the language they use is quite
easy to understand. For example, you can try 非诚勿扰 which is a fine
movie.\
\
About transcripts, almost every Chinese movie has subtitles. You can
look for subtitles files on websites like
[Shooter.cn](http://shooter.cn/)\
\
Personally, I learnt a lot from TV serials like
[李小龙传奇](http://www.youku.com/playlist_show/id_958534.html) or
[大时代](http://www.soku.com/search_video/q_%E5%A4%A7%E6%97%B6%E4%BB%A3)
. I never did vocabulary lists but the fact that you get used to the
characters and the way they talk really helps to get idiomatic
expressions that every people actually use in daily life.\
\
Also as each movie deal with one (or several) specific topic(s), there
is some words that you will see again and again until you will have no
way but to look them up - and then you will already know how to use
them.\
\
Last thing : watch the kind of movies that you like. Don\'t force
yourself (or your students) into boring things. Learning a language is
just about understanding how you like to use it, so just enjoy ! There
is lots of great things in Chinese cinema.
