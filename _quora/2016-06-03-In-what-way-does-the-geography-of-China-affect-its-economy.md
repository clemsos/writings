    In what way does the geography of China
    affect its economy? - Quora
---

Like in any places in the world, it is not that China's geography
"affects" economy, it is that it will determine it. You can not easily
trade if you are stuck in mountains and you can not quietly grow
business quietly when you are over-exposed. Look at a map of China :
mountains, water, roads, everything that exists was built upon those
resources.

Pro-tip : even though there is a strong bias in current studies to think
that econometrics equlas economics, numbers and metrics can barely touch
the surface of how economies really develop. Understanding economics
means understanding history, geography and ultimately culture. See this
answer : [What are the most significant
flawed assumptions in economics? In particular, what assumptions have
led to incorrect theories which have been used to justify harmful and
failed public
policies?](http://quora.com/What-are-the-most-significant-flawed-assumptions-in-economics-In-particular-what-assumptions-have-led-to-incorrect-theories-which-have-been-used-to-justify-harmful-and-failed-public-policies/answer/Cl%C3%A9ment-Renaud)
