    What are some nice locally made Thai gifts that will be appreciated by
    people in China?

My wife got a very nice wallet and a comb from her brother when he got
back from Thailand. Also his wife brought different soaps for the
family. Everyone was happy with their gifts. (All of them are Chinese
living in the mainland).
