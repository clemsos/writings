Not really. It is good enough if you fly to Europe or Mediterranean
region. There is also international companies that goes further such as
Emirates, but it lacks of direct routes to Eastern Asia for instance. It
has been expanding recently with a new terminal and traffic is
increasing as well so new routes may open.

One of the reason is that you have Geneva and Paris at less than 2h
distance by train where you can fly everywhere in the world, so most of
the time it makes more sense to get a direct flight from one of these
cities than to fly from Lyon and change planes.

Another issue is that the local public transportation to the airport is
a shame. There is only one tramway which is under a monopoly so pricing
is ridiculously high and the line is often disfunctional. Alternative
public transport options are banned because of the monopoly. You can
uber in but the existing train could just be operated better.

As much as I love living in this city, its airport is not the best part.
