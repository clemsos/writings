    How do people benefit from building free
    open source frameworks?
---

Presenting open-source as a hobby is an untrue way to look at it. Most
open-source code comes from huge commercial and very profitable
projects. Talks about open-source as a hobby / way of life are usually
marketing to make the tech geeks look like the saviors of the world.\
\
Let\'s look at Linux kernel or even Android. It is developed mostly by
people that are paid to do so, not by hobbyists on their Sunday
afternoon. Many of the best coders are paid to integrate new features
for the service they are working on. If I sell server hosts, I need it
to be working properly so I will track bugs, add patches, test and
integrate new features, etc. I use what have already been built by
others for my own business. Who wants to rewrite a whole OS and every
piece of software each time you open a new website? That was how people
did things 30 years ago.\
\
Now for smaller project, the logic is the same. Let\'s say you need to
convert specific part of your websites into images. You write some
library that does it but you don\'t have enough time to optimize the
code, fix the bugs, support different formats , etc. So what you do is :
you open-source your draft and advertise it as a \"cool\" project. Some
other guys that also need to convert pages to images find your project.
They may fix a few bugs, add some more features. You can now integrate
their work in your own website, which then become better.\
\
So there is a pretty clear economical logic to open-source, not related
to any hobby. There are also hobbyist projects, of course but they are
often built on top of bigger open-source code. For instance, you could
make an open-source camera drone in your local hackerspace but then you
will be using tons of existing code that have been produced during
commercial projects.\

Hope it is clearer now !
