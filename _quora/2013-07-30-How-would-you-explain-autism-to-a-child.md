explain your son autism, ask him why he thinks the other child is
violent sometimes. He may look closer next time and start to understand
(and be safer then).\
\
Tell him that people aren\'t all the same and that\'s the child violent
behavior is just a reaction to some things he dislikes. People behavior
is not automatic just like a machine but is an interaction, an exchange.
Autistic people may have different way to sense and feel things so your
son has to be careful when he interacts with him. What it takes is an
attempt to understand him.\
\
For instance, many autistic children dislike big noises and too much
agitation around them but your son can have calm activities with him. I
think it is very good to understand as a child that people have
different ways to show emotions and that therefore you should use
different ways to talk to them / be with them.\
\
Don\'t go tell him \"something is wrong with this child\'s brain\"
because this is nonsense and it won\'t help your son to understand
anything. Instead of this, what about some empathy? It is a wonderful
quality and it should be cultivated all the time.\
\
Autistic people can show so much love and sometimes reveal to us entire
parts of life that we are completely missing, being so desperately
\"normal\". Maybe their behavior is mysterious and scary but it
shouldn\'t be introduced to a child as \"abnormal\" and
\"problematic\".\
\
What children should be taught is to challenge themselves to love
others, because this is a true value for the rest of their life. People
can get so different, but you can\'t just ignore them. At the end of the
day, you have to live with others and that is all that matters.
