For China :\

-   Contact China Digital Times <http://chinadigitaltimes.net/> and
    their supporters, especially the Berkeley Counter-Power Lab
    [http://chinadigitaltimes.net/abo\...](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/about/sponsors/)
-   Write to Fan Qiang ( i.e. bypass GFW in Chinese 翻墙)
    <iaskfq@gmail.com>
-   Ping guys at Global Voices
-   Post it on Hacker News

\
Those sources may be able to help you spread the word and support with
introducing community members fighting censorship in other countries.
