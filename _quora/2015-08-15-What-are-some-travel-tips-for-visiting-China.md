can print a card with written 我不要  which means \"I don\'t want\" .
You can show it to people in touristic spots that want to sell you
random stuff. You can even write 我真的不要 on the other side, meaning
\"I really don\'t want\". It is a funny way to avoid being repeatedly
asked for buying things, and a good way to engage conversation if you\'d
like to.
