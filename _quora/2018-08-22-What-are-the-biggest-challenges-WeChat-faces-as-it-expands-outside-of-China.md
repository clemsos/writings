    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What are the biggest challenges WeChat faces
    as it expands outside of China? - Quora

Outside China, it won\'t benefit from the giant user base Tencent had
already when it launched in China.

People tends to consider Wechat as a brand new app which quickly
acquired a billion users in a few years. This is only half of the story.
A large part of the original users was dragged from what was already the
biggest social network on Earth even before Facebook came to existence :
Tencent QQ. I registered Wechat using my QQ account and so did all my
friends back then. People all started using Wechat because QQ mobile was
such a pain. QQ was essentially cheaper and more convenient than phone
already for years. People needed to bring the social connections built
with QQ, Qzone and all Tencent services on their mobile. Wechat solved
that problem perfectly.

Even if Tencent has been executing brilliantly on Wechat, the app is not
getting such a huge initial advantage anywhere anytime soon.
