    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What are the biggest data science success
    stories so far? It might be interesting to make a distinction between
    two cases: 1. When data analysis is applied to enhance business 2. When
    data analysis is the business - Quora

I think the Great Firewall of China, gigantic censorship system of the
Chinese government is a good example of what can be achieved with data
science. It monitors millions of tweets, posts, links, pages,
automatically block requests containing certain keywords, etc. Plus it
does that at the scale of the whole Chinese Internet which is hundreds
of millions of users and billions of strings of texts to process each
minute.\
\
The system is also distributed into services of (private) companies
which have to follow and implement restrictions announced by the
government, i.e. create advanced internal data mining system to monitor
and delete \"sensitive\" user content.\
\
Sina, company who creates Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) has
to monitor every tweet and detect \"illicit\" content, block \"suspect\"
users, etc. The system can not cope with all things but let\'s say it
does well the (dirty) job it is supposed to do.\
\
On a business point of view, it may not be that powerful at a first
glance as it is just blocking and doesn\'t have direct outcomes. Yet it
empowers Chinese politics to keep their current business ongoing and
have extensive control on public discussions\...\
\
Data enthusiasts (as myself) may find it very depressing but the Great
Firewall seems to be the biggest data real-time analysis piece of
engineering actually in service on earth.\
\
Once again, greatest technological success can easily become the biggest
threats for our human life\...
