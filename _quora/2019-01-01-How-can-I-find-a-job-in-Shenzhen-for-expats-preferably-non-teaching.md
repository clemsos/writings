    preferably non-teaching? - Quora

If you can, take a plane and get there.

People in Shenzhen are usually friendly, but they also tend to be very
busy so you will have to find a good selling point for yourself\
\
Keep an open mind about things.\
Focus on observing and learning from what you see.

If you can get up to speed and keep meeting people, chances are that you
will find a job of some sort.

It is a fascinating city. Good luck!
