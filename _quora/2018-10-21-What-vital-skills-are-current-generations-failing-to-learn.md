    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What vital skills are current generations
    failing to learn? - Quora
---

They fail to learn what the generations before fail to pass them.

They fail to save money because their parents live their whole life on
credit. They fail to work hard because schools spoiled them instead of
teaching them the value of building things by themselves. They lack
empathy because they parents didn\'t even raise an eyebrow while looking
to death and war on TV every night. They think they deserve more because
society made them think they were so important. They don\'t know the
first think about nature and agriculture because all food they ever ate
came from Walmart.

Inheritance is the most decisive factor in life, despite all human
efforts to invent something fairer. The effects of breeding and
education are visible over generations. The failures and flaws of a
generation are the the reflects of the previous ones.
