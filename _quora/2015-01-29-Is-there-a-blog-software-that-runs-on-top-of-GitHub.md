    Is there a blog software that runs on top of
    GitHub?

Every rep, organization or user on Github can have its own blog pages
hosted by Github. You can for instance create a \"gh-pages\" branch and
your pages will appear as \"rep-name . github. io\" . Read the complete
documentation here : [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
