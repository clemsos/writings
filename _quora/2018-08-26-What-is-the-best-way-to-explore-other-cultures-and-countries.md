    What is the best way to explore other
    cultures and countries? - Quora

Spend time there alone without travelling too much. Take the time to
grow relationships and make friends. You will know if you enjoy the
local life once you start sharing moments of daily life with the locals.
That requires to stay in some place for a while instead of being on the
road.
