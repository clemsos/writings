title: 'What are the things that can only be done in Wuhan, China?'
---

-   Attend a crowded show of a Chinese punk band playing bagpipes and
    meet people writing anarchist pamphlets in a squat in China.
-   Listen to hundreds of students recitating and reading aloud their
    English texbooks facing a wall while another hundred is having
    military training on the other side.
-   Visit eleven brand new and almost empty university campus in a
    single day.
-   Watch some Chinese business man playing with a dragon kite for an
    hour on the banks of the Yangzi river.
-   Taste the typical Wuhanese breakfast by going in a small backstreet
    behind a university in the early morning. Enjoy the crowd and the
    life there and just \"get across the morning\" (*guozao)* with some
    delicious food ( hot noodles, tofu and eggs, etc.)
