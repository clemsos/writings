    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Why is the plural of \'grand prix\'
    sometimes written as \'grands prix\'? - Quora
---

It is a French word. "Prix" means price and does not change in plural
form because it ends with an "x". "Grand" - which means big - takes an
additional "s" when used for plural.

Un grand prix, des grands prix.
