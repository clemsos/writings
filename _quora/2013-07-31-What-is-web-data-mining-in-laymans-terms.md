    Clément Renaud\'s answer to What is web data mining in layman\'s terms?
    - Quora
---

Think about the web as a big dump of data (web pages, posts, images,
etc.). Then the mining is the attempt to recycle all those pieces of
information into something that makes sense.\
\
It is often used to analyze complicated online trends and events, as the
recollection and organization of those pieces can lead to special
insights.\
\
It is called mining because people tends to describe the process as an
\"extraction\" of meaning or value from pretty much random content.
