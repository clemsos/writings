    As a non-Chinese, how do you feel about the
    \'Occupy Central\' movement of Hong Kong?
---

It is originaly an interesting initiative following Occupy Wall Street
and the reflexions about the role and practices of the financial sector
worldwide. Having this critical reflexion about the money business in HK
is really needed as it is such a key piece of the global banking
system.\
\
Currently, the scope have shift from the global case of banking to the
local case of Hongkongers protecting their own rights. By centering the
actions against Beijing and the CCP, it fails to grasp the bigger
picture and lower the political debate so it is now mostly lead by
haters.\
\
Hong Kong may be one of the most corrupted place in the world. Directing
Occupy Central\'s protesters hate towards Beijing looks like an easy
trick to not face the real problems ongoing there.
