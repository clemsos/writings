    Is it strange that the Great Chinese
    Firewall blocks Twitter but state-controlled media like Global Times use
    Twitter?

A nice paradox indeed :)\
\
Global Times is an English-language magazine, so they aim at reaching
readers outside China. For Global Times their role is to spread CCP
voice behind borders.\
\
Another thing is that many Chinese journalists writing about
international issues actually have Twitter accounts. There are also very
active discussions about China politics and social issues on Twitter,
not only among Chinese people but also including foreigners and people
from Taiwan & Hong-Kong.\
\
Chinese governmental media strategy is to build a global presence and be
part of those debates - to show muscles and maybe influence them. You
can read more about \"50 cent party\" which are people paid by CCP to
post governmental views into sensitive discussions.\
\
Global Times has a Twitter account because even if Twitter isn\'t part
of social media landscape within China, it is a major piece of media
worldwide and no international media can afford to avoid it, including
Chinese media.
