    Which writers have a profound understanding of the culture of Quebec and
    Montreal?

The greatest things I have read on this topic were written by Fernand
Dumont (1927-1997). Philosopher and sociologist, he discussed
extensively culture and the people of Quebec. He also wrote lots of
poetry and even his scholar works are really pleasant to read.\
\
One of my favorite quote from him is : *\"Culture is the house were we
live together\".* Simple and powerful. For me, he is Quebec\'s
Levi-Strauss.\
