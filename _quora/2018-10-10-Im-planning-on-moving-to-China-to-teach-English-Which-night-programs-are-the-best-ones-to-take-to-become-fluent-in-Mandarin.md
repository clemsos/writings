    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to I\'m planning on moving to China to teach
    English. Which night programs are the best ones to take to become fluent
    in Mandarin? - Quora

Think at this English teacher job like a night program. Then ask

Besides there is no night programs to learn Chinese. Just talk to people
there.
