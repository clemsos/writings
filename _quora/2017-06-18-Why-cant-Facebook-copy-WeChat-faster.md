Maybe they are losing time trying to come up with better ideas, instead
of re-using things that are proved to work already.

This idea of "copying" makes tech people in the West feel unconformable
because they think so much rely on their own creativity. Actually,
despite all the fuzz around inventors, the important thing with tech is
how relevant it is to the people, place and time where it is used.

Copying is already not easy and takes time. Making a point of never
copying is just foolish.
