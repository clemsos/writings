    How would you visualize interactive graphs
    on a webpage with a time scale (nodes, edges disappearing depending on
    time)? Is there a framework for this? Currently I\'m considering D3 or
    sigma.JS, but I can\'t really find examples for these. - Quora

I have developed an open-source tool exactly for that purpose :
[http://topogram.io](https://topogram.io)

You can download it or use the online version. Also if you have
questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
