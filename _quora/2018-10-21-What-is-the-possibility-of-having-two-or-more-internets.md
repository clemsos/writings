    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What is the possibility of having two or
    more internets? - Quora
---

Raise your head and take a good look around you. Do you seriously think
all these people use exactly the same websites and apps as you do
everyday?

If the answer is yes, move to another district, city or country and try
again. Find different social circles, poorer and richer than you, with
different languages and backgrounds.

Now, look at your original question. Do you think it is possible to have
only one single Internet, even if people lives are so different?
