    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to What do you think of Asians who are always
    gathering and using their mother tongue to communicate? - Quora
---

In addition to Paul\'s answer I will say that hanging with other
nationals of your country and discuss in your mother tongue while abroad
is just a natural thing. In years living in China, I have seen many
groups of Americans and none of them was using Chinese to communicate.\
\
When you actually live abroad it just feels good to be with people that
share the same culture and language as yours sometimes, because the
experience of entering a completely different culture can really be
overwhelming.\
\
About making friends with them, what about asking them about their
language? learning a few words? talk with them about their culture? Show
some basic interest in who people are may be a good option to become
friends with them.\
\
Also maybe to enter a group of people while they are having a discussion
is not the best way to meet them. Try to talk to them separately - they
may even speak English.
