    What have been the consequences of the
    French law banning the Burka?
---

One of the main consequence has been to create a long and painful racist
debate within the French society that has once again given occasions for
all sort of extremely binary-minded and scary persons to reach a larger
audience.\
\
The other main consequence has been to force the people wearing Burka to
stay only in the few districts often remote from city centers where
others still tolerate - i.e. understand - them. This was pretty much the
case before anyway because of latent hate and fear towards Middle East
Muslims in France.\
\
Â This sort of law didn\'t actually intend to change anything or even to
be enforced. Politics in France have been flooded by those sort of
so-called \"laws\" that are mostly attempts to seduce radical voters
with racist statements and prevent them from hating the state.\
\
As a final answer, the main consequence of such a law is just making
things worst for everyone by tearing the country apart when the
situation just requires people to urgently talk to each other.
