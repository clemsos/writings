    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Did the Anthropocene epoch begin in say
    1950, or does one select a much earlier date, e.g., 2000 BC? - Quora

It is a highly debated question nowadays in the scientific community. If
you think in terms of geological eras then the answer does not matter so
much, as Earth eon datation is more likely to occur in hundreds of
thousands or even millions of years.

That being say, the most convincing argument to me is to consider the
period when humans started to actively intervene in the carbon cycle.
Carbon transformation is a major geological activity of the different
ecospheres, so that part of the argument makes sense.

About the exact date, I have heard many researchers talking about the
end of the 19th century. At that time, manufacturing processes started
to burn coal and fossil energies at an industrial scale. Some goes as
far as taking 1784, the year when the steam machine was patented, as the
marker (French researchers Bonneuil and Fressoz). I found it a bit
exaggerated, and thought it expressed more their agenda that a deep
scientific reflection.

The broader question - when did humans started to influence the course
of this planet - does not have so far a satisfying answer. In my
opinion, it is a good thing and we should keep it that way for now. It
offers us a great opportunity to reconsider human history and condition
under a new light, and asking ourselves how we have become part of this
world.
