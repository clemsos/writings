    Is there any lawsuit between Sina Weibo and Twitter because they are
    identical?
---

No, there isn\'t one.\
\
Besides : what make you think they are identical ?\
\
Both are completely different in content, UI, community, features, etc.
Only thing is maybe the 140 characters length for messages, but this was
originally a property of phone text message that Twitter reproduced.
