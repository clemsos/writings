    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Is there a single word for teaching and
    learning? - Quora

Not really an answer to your question but in French, the verb
*\"apprendre\"* means both. For instance : *\"J\'apprends les maths\"*
mean *\"I am learning math\"* or *\"I am teaching math\"* according to
the context.
