    How do French men feel about being forbidden
    by law to request a paternity test? - Quora
---

The restrictions on paternity tests are the expression of an idea that
is very important in France : family, and to larger extent identity and
country, should not be defined by blood or DNA, but by sharing a common
education, history and care for each others.

DNA tests are not forbidden but should only be used to support a
decision from a judge regarding settlement of family matters. It should
not be used by individuals to argue about who belongs to a family or
not.

It prevents people from trying to settle complex family situations by
using fallacious arguments and protect kids from abusive claims by
family members.

I think it totally makes sense.
