    My IQ is 84. How can I get into Stanford?
---

Don\'t take IQ test results too seriously, they are usually worthless.
Find something that you enjoy and go for it. Learn, fail, try harder and
you will see amazing things happen.\
\
Also, there is no need to go to Stanford to do science or technology.
Millions of brilliant people never set a single foot in California in
their own life and are doing these everyday very successfuly (this is a
bias from Quora).\
\
Just find something you like to learn, pursue it, have fun - and pain
sometimes. Don\'t compete with others, just be your best self. The world
is full of roads, just go try them. The only test you have to succeed is
life.
