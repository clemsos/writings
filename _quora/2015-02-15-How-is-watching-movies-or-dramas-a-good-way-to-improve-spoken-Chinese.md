    Clément Renaud\'s answer to How is watching movies or dramas a good way
    to improve spoken Chinese? - Quora

Yes, you will learn the words and expressions in situation, which will
help you to improve your overall comprehension about how to use this or
that phrase. There is subtitles on every Chinese TV serials on movies so
you can even use it to check words in a dictionary. It will usually also
give you good insights on how local people live and serials are the best
topic for casual conversation.\
\
Here are some practical advices from my own experience about learning
from TV. Stick to one single TV serial so you will get used to the way
actors talk and understand them better. You may also get more into the
story which helps to sustain your attention. Watch online so you can
rewind, pause, etc. When a scene looks more important, take your
dictionary and look up the words you don\'t know (write them down even).
When you get tired, don\'t bother : just watch the thing. It is OK if
you don\'t understand, just accept it and it will come with time.\
\
The most challenging part may be to find some interesting enough to
watch on Chinese TV. When I first arrived in China I watched all the
episodes of  *The Legend of Bruce Lee,* which was OK.\
\
Good luck with your learning !\
