    Parisian Chic: What are the best leather
    gloves in the market?
---

If you pass by Lyon in France, I strongly advise you make a halt in [Au
Gant Grenoblois](http://www.au-gant-grenoblois-cuir.fr/) . This little
shop is just beautiful and the lady who runs the place has tons of
different models, all made by her hand.
