    What are the main characteristics of the
    French language?
---

**An extreme, almost pathological concern about the time passing.**\
\
While English have sophisticated way to express the continuation of the
present (continuous forms), French language has multiple tenses to
express what happened in the past : passé composé, passé simple, passé
antérieur\... There is even the *plus-que-parfait* (literal meaning :
*more-than-perfect)* which is used to express actions that are anterior
to the past time of the sentence.\
\
There is a degree of precision to include the role of time in stories
and history that is really fascinating.
