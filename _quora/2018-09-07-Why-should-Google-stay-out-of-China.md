title: 'Cl√©ment Renaud\''s answer to Why should Google stay out of China?'
---

Because nobody in China has forgotten how Google shamefully blamed the
Chinese government for its total failure to gain traction on the Chinese
market against Baidu.

They totally lost the business battle and tried to max out their exit by
bashing China big time. Like many other foreign companies operating in
China, they couldn\'t figure out the rules so blamed their own failure
on "censorship".

They were millions of Chinese users that loved Google and felt totally
betrayed by this PR move[\[1\]](#FRGOL) . You can not insult your users
and think they will keep on coming back.

Yes China is a hard market and it takes time to understand Chinese
consumers. The Brits started a war a century ago because they couldn\'t
sell their products in China.

How do you manage to understand enough of the local context so you can
make Chinese customers use your product? If Google can not answer that
question, they should not try to come back.
