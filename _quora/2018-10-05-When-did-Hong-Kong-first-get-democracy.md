    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to When did Hong Kong first get democracy? -
    Quora
---

It never did. Hong Kong has been integrated in China successive empires
since the Qin dynasty (214 BCE), then become a colony of the British
empire after the Opium war (1842), then was handed back over to the PRC
in 1997. None of these regimes were democratic. There has been
discussion about a possible transition since 1997, but there is zero
prior history of HK being a democracy.
