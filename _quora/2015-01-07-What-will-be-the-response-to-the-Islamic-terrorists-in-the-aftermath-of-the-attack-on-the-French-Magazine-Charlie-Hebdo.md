    Hebdo? - Quora

According to the actual political climate in France, I will say that
this event will allow far-right parties to gain enormous traction.
People are shocked, and after being scared many will want to \"do
something\" by becoming active to protect the civil society. Big
organisations like political parties and associations will then welcome
them to become militant. \
\
There won\'t be a direct \"backlash against muslims in general\" (as
stated in the question), but the National Front and other anti-islam
groups will have more space in the media to preach the \"cultural war\"
between Western and Muslim countries. They will also benefit from
massive support from all over Europe and the world under the flag of
\"protecting the values\".\
\
In many of the main cities of France, violent and non-violent anti-islam
groups have already been pretty active in recruiting new members and
train themselves to talk to the cameras. This trend will grow faster. In
this dark day, I don\'t see anything that can really prevent the
National Front to win the next presidential election in France. Hollande
is weak, Sarkozy is a mess and other left-wing party doesn\'t seem to
have enough structure nor experience.\
\
It is really a sad day for France and the rest of the world. Many doors
that were still open are now closing and there is so many people on the
paths of war that we will have to be stronger than ever to not fall into
the big trap our world is offering us.
