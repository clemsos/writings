    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to Which one is better for learning Mandarin in
    Shanghai, Fudan, SJTU, or SISU? - Quora
---

The first year of Chinese language classes at any univ in China is
pretty useless. Classes are super easy and basic, for foreigners that
mostly wants to have fun. At the end of the year, everybody gets a nice
and useless diploma before heading back home where they tell everyone
how awesome China is. That is why the Chinese gov is distributing
scholarships.

From the 2nd year on, things change as only the most motivated are left.
Most students are Korean or Japanese and teacher\'s expectations raise
drastically. At that point, univ can be of some help if you are really
committed to learning Chinese.

Truth is, you don\'t need univ to learn Chinese. Just go where life is
cheaper, so you don\'t have to worry about money. Try Wuhan or Chengdu.
These are nice places to live as a student.
