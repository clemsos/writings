    Clément Renaud\'s answer to Is it safe to travel to Greece? If I travel
    there, do I need to take any precautions? - Quora
---

Yes, absolutely safe. I am travelling in Greece right now and there is
many tourists. Everything still there : incredible scenery, superb food,
small cafes - and endless discussions about politics and the future of
Greece if you want.\
\
Many Greek people have been suffering from last 5-6 years of crisis but
life goes on anyway, and they are as friendly and hospitable as they
always were.\
\
A Greek friend of mine went to the airport yesterday pick up someone.
When she came back she said to me : *\"When I saw those families of
tourists getting out of the plane,  I was so cheered that I really
wanted to thank them and wish them all a very good time in my
country.\"*\

NB : No need to worry about ATM limitations because it doesn\'t apply to
foreign cards. I have tried it first hand 2 days ago.
