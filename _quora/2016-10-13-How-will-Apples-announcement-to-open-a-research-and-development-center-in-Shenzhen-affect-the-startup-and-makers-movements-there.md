    Cl√©ment Renaud\'s answer to How will Apple\'s announcement to open a
    research and development center in Shenzhen affect the startup and
    makers movements there? - Quora
---

The announcement is an important validation for the local maker scene,
as it sanctifies that Shenzhen's shift from factory hub to design center
is now consumed.

For Apple, opening a R&D center in Shenzhen is both mandatory and
opportunistic, regarding the importance of the city in tech world today.
Then, I am sort of skeptical about the company will to really relocate
research on key product lines there, besides the announcement effect.
Here are a few reasons :

-   Apple have to stay relevant in China to survive. Chinese people
    don't really buy Apple phones anymore because Chinese companies are
    totally better and cheaper today. Then, it is quite unlikely that
    Apple wants their product lines to adopt some China trends in UX,
    mobile, IoT, etc. Apple branding is all about *Designed in
    California* so integrating China-specific ideas will be shooting
    themselves in the foot.
-   Apple is coming to Shenzhen to show its total and unconditional
    commitment to the CCP. The company just made major investments in
    many domains (Didi, Apple Pay, etc.) so now it has to follow orders
    from the top or lose everything - like the others did. If Beijing
    say tomorrow that the new innovation hub is in Tibet, Apple may as
    well go there to save its ass.
-   It will be super hard for them to have anything really strategic in
    Shenzhen. Shenzhen is a small place and Chinese companies struggle
    to have basic loyalty from their own employees already. With a
    foreign company like Apple, business secrets will leak all over the
    place on day one --- good news for many local makers that will now
    be able to make fake iPhones based on real blueprints !

So, my wild guess about this Apple R&D center :

-   Apple play it safe and build a "learning center" which will be
    beneficial for local makers and Apple to exchange knowledge about
    design trends and markets. More big names in design and tech may
    resettle to Shenzhen to finally get a grasp of what the future of
    tech looks like. That movement may lead to the creation of new
    schools and campuses for training - which the city totally lacks
    currently.
-   The other option is that Apple wants to use it to explore new
    markets, like medical devices for instance. China aging population
    is the best market ever to sell connected medical devices. It also
    has the "legal flexibility" to experiment in that field without the
    hassle of Western legislation.
-   Shenzhen is a manufacturing powerhouse. The biggest ally of Apple
    locally is Foxconn which is Taiwanese and has been trying to
    relocate recently, which may cause Apple troubles. If Apple wants
    next-gen product it has to invest in next-gen supply chain.
    Guangdong and esp Shenzhen is the definite place where robots and
    automation will be brought to an entire new scale.
-   There is another possibility : this R&D center will turn out to be
    one of those Chinese "innovation hub" that looks really cool on the
    prospectus but are always empty. Mostly, putting Apple name on some
    insignifiant real-estate investment with 10 guys inside will buy
    peace with the mayor and make its friends in Beijing happy. It will
    also allow Apple to keep investing steadily in the Chinese market
    while keeping all its core assets in California.

Anyway, all of these scenarios are beneficial for local makers in
Shenzhen and China, mainly because they strengthen the presence of China
stakeholders in Apple businesses. Also there will be other side effects
(the in-famous "spillovers") but they look marginal in comparison of
what Shenzhen has already achieved without Apple.
