    Which universities are in Ningbo, China and which fields are they strong
    in?
---

I know Ningbo university have been experimenting with intedisciplinary
teaching as part of a very interesting project called
[Toyhouse](http://toyhouse.cc/), which is basically an online platform
where students have to share their homework. The Toyhouse project is run
by ex-MIT Pr. Ben Koo from Qinghua University and UNESCO and he has
setup a medialab in Ningo university focused on design and technology.\
\
They have actually a faculty teaching how to make music instruments
which have been cooperating through creative workshops with computer
science, design and engineering students . The concept of Toyhouse is to
bring a more playful environment for Chinese students to have
transversal projects between majors. This is pretty unique experience as
it aimed at License students and take place in the very static
environment of Chinese university. I remember they were building a sort
of boat-like device to collect garbages from the lake nearby - pretty
awesome homework actually.\
\
Also Ningbo University was hosting a big data center that should be
allocated for video learning and MOOC-like projects - but the allocation
is not happening AFAIK. The campus I am talking about is pretty remote
from the city, not sure if anything of those still happening now.
