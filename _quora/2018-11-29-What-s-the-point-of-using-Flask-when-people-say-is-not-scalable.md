    What's the point of using Flask when people
    say is not scalable?
---

Pinterest and LinkedIn use Flask.

What "people" say does not matter. Flask is solid and very flexible,
with extensive ecosystem and support. It can be used for big and small
projects.

Real question is : how big do you think you need to scale?
