title: 'Are you concerned by what is happening in Calais (France)?'
---

What is happening in Calais is absolutely dramatic and every citizen in
Europe should be concerned. People in total misery are actually paying
with their lives to reach our shores. This is not only a France-UK
problem, but more generally one the main question mark on the future of
Europe.\
\
Beyond any possible debate, what is happening currently in Calais is
first an incomparable human tragedy.  I have witnessed people being
tracked down by police in Paris at their workplace, in the streets, in
the subway. In Calais, those guys are digging holes in the woods to hide
themselves from the police. They spend days and weeks without proper
food and water, waiting for a moment to escape and finally reach the end
of their incredible journey. We are talking about hundred of thousands
of people living in Europe but who are not citizens, have absolutely no
rights (not even to work) and are hunt down by the police everyday. How
is it even possible ?\

**Each of these people has a different life story. I would like to give
an account by telling the story of one guy I met while I was in Paris in
2007**\
 \
Saturnin was born in Bamako, Mali.\
\
When he was 21, his father died, leaving the whole family without money.
As he was the elder boy, it was decided that he will stop studying and
go to France where an uncle there could help him find a job, so he can
send some money home.\

\
\
He left by bus from Bamako to cross the Mauritanian desert to reach
first Ceutta in Morroco, where he thought he could cross to Spain.
Ceutta and Mellila are two Spanish enclaves located inside the Morrocan
territory, just a few kilometers from the European coast. When he
arrived, they were thousands of people from all over Africa gathered in
the woods, waiting the right time to cross  the border. He tried to
approach the fences several times, but there were too many soldiers
guarding the place. Every night, some of the migrants will try to cross
and many will get hurt or shot in the process. There are tombs all
around in the woods, for all the people that died here from infection of
their wounds. He was waiting to take his decision when the Moroccan
police came with big buses for their monthly raid to clean the forest
from migrants and kick all these people out. There were chaos, shots,
people running in the woods and finally he got caught and throw in a bus
to the Algerian border.\

\
After a whole day of travel, they were unloaded totally illegally a
hundred kilometers away on the Algerian side of the border. The region
here is desertic and the group wander for a few days before they can
reach a local NGO that offer them food and water. Of course, all their
belongings were stolen before this last bus trip. The luckiest (those
who had escaped wars) were told that they could apply for asylum in the
city of Oujda. Saturnin decided to follow, thinking he could maybe find
work there and spare money to later reach Algiers and cross to France
eventually. Before they even reach Oujda, they were caught by the
Algerian police that lock them up in a camp. A few days later, they were
forced into a bus again, direction the Southern desert of Tamanrasset
where they could be sent back to the Northern border of Mali.\

\
Saturnin and another guy managed to escape during a stop, and ended up
almost alone in the desert. They manage to reach a small town where they
worked for a few months on the construction of a road. After some weeks,
they decided to get to the coast near Algiers where they could find a
smuggler. After more adventures, Saturnin finally arrived in Spain on a
small boat in the middle of a night. It took him months of work in
Andalusia to pay back the smuggler for the trip. Finally, he got rid of
its debts and went to Limoges, a small city in France where one of his
cousin has found him a job on a construction field. At some point, he
got to Paris and when I met him, he was trying to get his papers to find
a proper job, after multiple ripoffs by different bosses there.\

\
He was 25 years old back then. He told me that he would love to go to
the UK, because he loved the country from what he have seen in the
movies and music.\
\
This is the story of one single person. He was a very nice and decent
kid that loves his mother and all, not a job-stiller thug. He is not an
isolated case\*. They are thousands and thousands of people like him
coming to Europe everyday. Some have escaped war in Syria, torture in
Libya, they have crossed seas and mountains and risked their lives to
get there. I can tell you many others of their stories. Each one is as
different and complex, and as heartbreaking.\
\
Now, what is happening in Calais is not new. It has been ongoing for
years. This is not a French-British problem, but a European one - even a
global one. The presence of newcomers in our societies are one of the
biggest issues Europeans have to face today.\
\
Are we going to chase them and hunt them forever ? Are we going to try
to *exterminate* them ? We are already throwing them in camps all over
Europe. Does Europe want another *final solution* ? Or are we going to
welcome them, help them to tend their wounds and become part of Europe ?
Are we strong enough to see our failures, care for our humanistic values
and see how lucky we are to have such a lot of people willing to come
and help our nations to get better ? What sort of Europe do we want to
build ? Can we live up to the humanism of our peers ?\

\
Those guys are there, and they are not going anywhere. More still coming
everyday, maybe millions during the next decades and nothing will stop
it. [They are part of the present and the future of Europe]{.underline},
do we like it or not. The political answer to this situation will
determine the direction Europe will take. So far, we have chosen to take
again the most grim path of our past, with organized police throwing
second-class citizens in camps. We need serious debates, reflections and
actions if we want to avoid the worst scenario that have been prepared
for us.\
