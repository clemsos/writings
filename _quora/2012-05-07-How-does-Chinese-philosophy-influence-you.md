Think about a \"Chinese Philosophy\" can be very misleading. In fact,
there is no such thing as a \"Philosophy\" in (Ancient) China.\
\
During centuries, the absence of proper *logos* in Chinese classical
writings has lead thinkers from the West to consider Chinese thoughts
only as *wisdow*, that is *pre-philosophical*. The category of 哲学 used
today for \"philosophy\" in Chinese had only appeared at the end of the
19th century. Borrowed from the Japanese word *tetsugaku*, it aimed
mostly at giving credit to study of classic Chinese writing in a
universitary context dominated by Western influence.\
\
So what we usually called \"Chinese philosophy\" is a modern vision of
an heteroclit corpus that has finally only one common characteristic :
the language. Or more than the language, we should say the Chinese
writing system.\
\
In my opinion, the most influencial element of Chinese \"philosophy\" is
the intimate relation between the practice of thought and the gesture,
that is the practice of life. Art, language, painting, writing,
calligraphy, music are tied altogether in a way that has no equivalent
in Western history.\
\
For philosophers from the West, poetry, music and painting are great
thematics for analysis and starting points for their theories. In China,
they are exercises of the mind through constant practices. Here, a
certain conception of truth has to be found inside action, in the
perfectionment of the gesture (*gongfu* 功夫). For example, the practice
of description in the *Zhuang Zi* goes with a practice of meditation.
Both converge towards a clear endeavior : get closer to \"nature\"*,*
that is animal, plants, minerals, etc.\
\
This importance of the surrounding elements (all living things) versus
the internal life of a rational being that has been the subject of
Western metaphysics so far is another crucial element that Chinese
history of thoughts bring in the debate. In many writings (as the *Lao
Zi*), human seems to be located at the lowest degree in the hierarchy of
importance. The purpose of spiritual life and practice for humanity
(i.e. philosophy and religions) is to find a state of harmony with other
beings. Humans could access a better condition only if they success in
reaching the \"nature\" (自然) by *acting* or *non-acting* (無爲) in the
case of Taoism.\
\
This big idea of a daily practice/work to reach an harmony with nature
could be a great basis to rethink our relation to other beings in this
age of environmental crisis.
