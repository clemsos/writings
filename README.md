# ClÃ©ment Renaud's Writings

This repo contains things I wrote over the course of the years.

The goals are :

- consolidate previous writings into a single repo
- exit platforms and own my things locally
- convert everything into markdown (with meta and date)
- run some stats / generators for fun
- document how to do all that

## TODO

- Backup
  - [ ] Where did I write again?
  - [x] Quora
  - [X] Blogspot
  - [x] Tumblr Blogs
  - [x] Jekyll RW
  - [x] old Wordpress Blog
  - [ ] Other Jekylls (Ecriture Exemplaire, etc)
  - [ ] Scientific papers and conferences
  - [ ] media archives from https://clementrenaud.com/cv
  - [ ] Quora fr (require some date conversion)
  - [ ] other github repos
  - [ ] twitter (not worth it ?)
  - [ ] facebook (not worth it ?)
- Convert
  - [x] Define proper meta format: date, title, source, original_url
  - [x] HTML > markdown
- Tools / stats
  - [x] make UI / website
  - [ ] proper indexation for easy search
  - [x] words/ signs counter
  - [ ] trending words


## How To

### Backup Quora

1. Used https://github.com/t3nsor/quora-backup to backed things up and clean up html (successfully followed instructions).
2. Run `./bin/quora_convert_to_md.sh` to convert to md with proper names and dates (requires [pandoc](http://pandoc.org))
3. Manually copy PNG files to an `img` folder and find/replace `![](main-qimg` to fix paths

### Backup Blogspot

1. Get XML file from admin panel Settings/Others/Backup
2. Run `node bin/blogger2jekyll YOUR_FILE.xml _posts` to convert (based on a modified version of [blogger2jekyll](https://github.com/solderjs/blogger2jekyll))

### Backup Tumblr

Very straightforward: just use the official [Jekyll importer](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/), then some grep/replace to fix folders.

```
bundle exec jekyll import tumblr --url=http://clementrenaud.tumblr.com --format=md --grab_images --rewrite_urls
```

NB: Add some trouble due to GRDP policy that were preventing API calls... Finally found [a fix](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/issues/379).

### Import old Wordpress DBs

```
brew install mysql

mysql.server start

mysql > CREATE USER 'wp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$PASSWORD';
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'wp_user'@'localhost';

# import data
mysql -u wp_user -p$PASSWORD < $SQL_FILE_PATH

# import to jekyll
ruby -r rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::WordPress.run({
      "dbname"         => "clemsos_wp",
      "user"           => "wp_user",
      "password"       => "$PASSWORD",
      "table_prefix"   => "wp2_",
      "site_prefix"    => "",
      "clean_entities" => false,
      "extension"      => "md",
      "status"         => ["publish"]
    })'

```
