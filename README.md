# ClÃ©ment Renaud's Writings

This repo contains things I wrote over the course of the years.

The goals are :

- prove to myself that I can write (lol)
- consolidate previous writings into a single repo
- exit platforms and own my things locally
- convert everything into markdown (with meta and date)
- run some stats / generators for fun
- document how to do all that
