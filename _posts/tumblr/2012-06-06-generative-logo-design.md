# Definition : “A generative logo use a computer-based algorithm to provide different shapes as basis for a visual identity.”

**I was recently asking to create a logo and I thought about computer-based patterns/algorithm to generate it first.**

**Here are some examples of generative logo designs**

The MIT Media Lab visual identity has been created in 2011. It is not a simple logo but a matrix to randomly create more than 4000 possible shapes based on a same pattern, one for each person inside the Lab.[http://www.rt80.net/medialab/](http://www.rt80.net/medialab/)

Another pretty similar expeirment is the Casa Da Musica (Portugal). The logo by Sagmeister Inc provides different shapes based on a same logic to express every different kind of music that could be played inside the building&nbsp;[http://www.sagmeister.com/node/192](http://www.sagmeister.com/node/192)

The&nbsp;Slovenian&nbsp;company Renderspace has come up with a little program that helps them to generate logo each time they like it&nbsp;[http://designyoutrust.com/2009/02/renderspace-generated-identity/](http://designyoutrust.com/2009/02/renderspace-generated-identity/)

Many great example are to be found within the awesome [Processing](http://processing.org/) community, like this logo for a brand named SoundsGood.

In 2009, the UN Climate Change Conference&nbsp;in Copenhagen has hired the london-based studio&nbsp;[okdeluxe](http://www.okdeluxe.co.uk/)&nbsp;which has used Processing to create the logo of the event :&nbsp;[http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/cop15-identity-processing/](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/cop15-identity-processing/)
