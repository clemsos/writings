Just to share some articles I wrote some time ago on Future Challenges.

[Future Challenges](http://futurechallenges.org/) is published by the German giant Berstellman. The content organization is interesting : editors publish a “lead article” to introduce a topic and a worldwide team of bloggers respond to it with their “local views”. So you can get points of views from many different countries on a same topic. I&nbsp;am currently covering China, here are some samples :&nbsp;

- [From Wall Street to Central: How OWS is seen in China](http://futurechallenges.org/in-focus/from-wall-street-to-central-how-ows-is-seen-in-china/)
- [The Difficulties of Students in China on the Employment Market](http://futurechallenges.org/local/difficulties-of-students-in-china-in-the-labour-market/)
- [Water Sales vs Environmental Activists in Hubei](http://futurechallenges.org/local/water-sales-vs-environmental-activists-in-hubei/)
