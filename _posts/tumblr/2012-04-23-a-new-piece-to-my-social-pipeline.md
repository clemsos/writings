I am really fed up with **reposting** info&nbsp;to dozens of social networks services and still need such a long time to find works I have published. It is both very repetitive and time-consuming, two things that I like to avoid in my daily life as far as possible.

Isaac Mao&nbsp;[discuss](http://wp.isaacmao.com/2011/06/29/ifttt-%E4%B8%8E%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%AF%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E2%80%9Dshareable-service%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7/)&nbsp;recently the new possibility offered to link web services to create what he called a&nbsp;[social pipeline](http://www.isaacmao.com/meta/2008/02/micropipeline-as-unblockable.html). To chain social networks has enable him to cross censorship borders, as even CCP cannot close every web services out there. For me, it is more about **archiving** and gathering in one place the best of what I am producing and publishing online. So far, I still not have the habit to update frequently&nbsp;[my old website](http://www.clemsos.com)&nbsp;and [blog](http://www.clemsos.com/blog), which imply that i didn't&nbsp;keep track of my recent projects and publications.

Now it is becoming quite problematic to explain what I have been doing for last 2 years so I’ve decided to start&nbsp; **this blog** to gather stuff I have been publishing recently.&nbsp;I use to recommend Tumblr&nbsp;to many non-tech friends, as it has a pretty straightforward and clean interface.

So I will be posting updates from here from now on.

Hope you’ll enjoy reading !&nbsp;
