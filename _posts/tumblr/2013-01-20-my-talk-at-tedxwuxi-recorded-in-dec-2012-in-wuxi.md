My talk at&nbsp;[TEDxWuxi](http://tedxwuxi.org/archives/542)&nbsp;recorded in Dec&nbsp;2012 in Wuxi, China.&nbsp;The thing was called _Urban Organology_ and intended to show a snapshot of some research I am doing right now&nbsp;about tech, memes, urbanity and – organs.

in Chinese.

The more I am trying to understand the relationships between actual urban space and our social world online, the more I am confused by finding myself surrounded by&nbsp;disparate&nbsp;objects. Technological devices, Internet memes, fast-growing cities, air pollution, cultural memories : all those seem to be related in some discrete manner, though I have no real clue on how to unravel it.

Moreover when dealing with scientific research, I just don’t see how the different methodological and conceptual&nbsp;approaches at my disposal&nbsp;could honestly answer those questions. There is&nbsp;such a mess of meanings and structure out there, we may need some closer observations methods and thinking models to describe what is actually happening.

That is why I came up with this weird idea of _Urban Organology_: to anatomize the body to this global brain-in-a-vat that Internet has became today,&nbsp;the so-called “collective intelligence”. To read Stiegler, Deleuze, Leroi-Gourhan, hacker blogs, API documentations, social networks datasets and to live in huge Chinese cities made me think of this cheap sci-fi vision of our&nbsp;world as organs.

It has nothing innovative really and if you are focused on research deliveries and outcomes, this talk may not&nbsp;seem very consistent to you. Take it as an attempt to express some unfinished views on unstable objects.&nbsp;

Plus, I will add that to express such thoughts&nbsp;in Chinese was quite challenging to me as well.

So, I am not so sure about the result but I had fun doing this TedX talk anyway :)
