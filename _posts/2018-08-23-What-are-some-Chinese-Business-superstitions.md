Some numbers means something.

8 represents happiness, so to make people happy you pay them with
numbers containing the most 8 possible. 18,88 is a great number because
in Chinese it sounds like "you will get rich, rich, rich". On the other
hand, you should avoid 250. It means "stupid" when said in a certain way
*(erbaiwu* instead of *liangbaiwu)*.

Also one thing I have observed is that you mostly don\'t say numbers
aloud. You write them down. Calculators or cell phones make great
writing boards to negociate.
