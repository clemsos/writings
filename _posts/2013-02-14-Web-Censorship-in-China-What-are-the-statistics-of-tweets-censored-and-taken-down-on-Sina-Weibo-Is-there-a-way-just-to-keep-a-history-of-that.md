> With Twitter and Facebook blocked in China, the stream of information

> media behavior under the inﬂuence of active censorship.\
> While much work has looked at efforts to prevent access to information
> in China (including IP blocking of foreign websites or search engine
> ﬁltering), we present here the ﬁrst large-scale analysis of political
> content censorship in social media, i.e., the active deletion of
> messages published by individuals.\
> \
> In a statistical analysis of 56 million messages (212,583 of which
> have been deleted out of 1.3 million checked, more than 16%) from the
> domestic Chinese microblog site Sina Weibo, and 11 million
> Chinese-language messages from Twitter, we uncover a set a politically
> sensitive terms whose presence in a message leads to anomalously
> higher rates of deletion. We also note that the rate of message
> deletion is not uniform throughout the country, with messages
> originating in the outlying provinces of Tibet and Qinghai exhibiting
> much higher deletion rates than those from eastern areas like
> Beijing.\
