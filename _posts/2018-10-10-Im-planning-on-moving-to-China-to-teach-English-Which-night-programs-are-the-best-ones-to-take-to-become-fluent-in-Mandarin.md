    I\'m planning on moving to China to teach English. Which night programs
    are the best ones to take to become fluent in Mandarin?

Think at this English teacher job like a night program. Then ask
yourself what am I going to do with my all that time while in China?

Besides there is no night programs to learn Chinese. Just talk to people
there.
