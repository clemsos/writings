<p><strong><a href="http://www.vuvox.com">Vuvox </a> </strong>is an online application that allows you to create interactive and multimedia collage. The <em>collages </em>take the form of a big multimedia scroll with as many interactive bubbles and interactions as you want. Choose a topic, gather your pictures, sounds and videos and reach for an Internet connection. You're ready.</p>
