<p>My favorite online mag <a href="www.owni.eu ">OWNI</a> in France just got <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/ona-awards-recognise-innovation-in-investigative-and-data-journalism/s2/a541300/">rewarded</a> for the second time  by the US Online News Association's (ONA) annual awards for its<em> General Excellence in Online Journalism prize for a non-English small site. </em></p>
<p><em> </em>Yes. Even if they are a bunch of French people, they are now maintaining <a href="www.owni.eu">an english version</a>. The whole things start in 2009 with the creation of a blog community hostile to  HADOPI  - a twisted law which aimed to (de)regulate access Internet in France. Founded to protect digital rights in France, it has already become an example of what online journalism can produce of pertinent content (from <a href="http://data.owni.fr/">datajournalism</a> to topic-related<a href="http://app.owni.fr/mortsauxfrontieres/index.php?lang=en"> app</a>) and subversive tools, like the <a href="http://warlogs.owni.fr/">Irak warlogs browser</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Dynamic of innovation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><em>"OWNI is a state-of-the-art model for augmented journalism without advertising or paywalls."</em>, quote <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/ona-awards-recognise-innovation-in-investigative-and-data-journalism/s2/a541300/">journalism.co.uk</a> in <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/ona-awards-recognise-innovation-in-investigative-and-data-journalism/s2/a541300/">an interview with the founder</a>. But how can you sustain a media without advertisement? Especially when all your content is available for free under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/fr/">Creative Commons Licence</a> ?</p>
<p>The real engine that keeps OWNI turning is innovation: "<em>We are</em><em> lab of serendipity" </em>in<em>"permanent beta. We</em> do <em>innovation journalism</em>", as one of the founder Nicolas Voisin explained <a href="http://owni.fr/2010/12/02/edito-novembre-owni-laboratoire-media-augmente/">in its NOv 2009 editorial</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are an innovative Media Group:</p>
<p>- Innovation as an editorial process<br />
Editorial based on mid/long-term projects (topics) that gather designers, programmers, journalists, bloggers, etc.</p>
<p>- Innovation as a topic</p>
<p>impact of digital new media on society and its mutation</p>
<p>- Innovation as an economy of independence<br />
Mixt economy profit/non-profit : "we keep control on our shareholders : we owned 70% of the capital"</p></blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Write code to sustain content</span></h3>
<p>OWNI is curated by 22mars SAS, a <em>"social media edition society"</em> that aims to design and build social media, t. The revenues come as follow :</p>
<ul>
<li>20% from consulting and</li>
<li>40% website creation - for other online publications</li>
<li>40% augmented application and data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p><em>"The overabundance of information provoked a collapse in advertising revenu (...). The line of code is the winning line for a digital press publisher " </em>claims Nicolas Voisin.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Between profit and non-profit</span></h3>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The non-profit platform <a href="http://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a> has <a href="http://owni.fr/2010/04/13/propublica-remporte-un-pulitzer-la-fin-de-lhypocrisie-dune-linformation-for-profit/">proved</a> recently the value that can be produced by this kind of media in being awarded of a <a href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/in_the_news/119148/propublica_pulitzer_proves_the_internet">Pulitzer Prize</a>. Funded  by the American billionaire, Herbert M. Sandler, it is now run  with a budget of <a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2009/09/size-matters-in-non-profit-news.html">around 10 million/year</a>. Another proof of " <em>The attractiveness of the hybrid profit/non-profit model allows for fiscal synergies" </em>through donations mechanisms.</p>
<p>In parallel of OWNI's editorial activities, a non-profit 501(c) owned by the founders has been created, authorizing those kind of low-rate loan (€250k, 0% APR) from the mother structure to OWNI (<a href="http://editors.owni.fr/2010/04/27/a-french-revolution-for-the-business-model-of-news/">read more here</a>).</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Strong editorial guidelines and content structuration</span></h3>
<p>To conclude, I'd like to quote OWNI editor's <a href="http://editors.owni.fr/2010/04/27/a-french-revolution-for-the-business-model-of-news/">blog</a> to give an overview of the editorial objectives they have fixed to themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lab for innovative journalism, OWNI must always remain on the cutting edge of what’s new in <strong>datajournalism</strong>, a new way of presenting information with<strong>visualizations</strong>, dynamic <strong>infographics</strong>, <strong>database</strong> journalism and <strong>interactive </strong>tools. (...) OWNI wanted to offer its audience <strong>constructive</strong>, <strong>critical</strong> and<strong>technophile ideas</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the big challenge of the next decade where the advertising-only business model has taken over most of online media, it seems finally that online writing and journalism will not perish so easily. When writing code and news has never been closer, a new guidelines for news policies inspired by innovation and open-source movement + a deeper implication  in all layers of social activities will bring this renewal to the whole profession. And also some new hopes for readers to eventually get some information worth to be read.</p>
