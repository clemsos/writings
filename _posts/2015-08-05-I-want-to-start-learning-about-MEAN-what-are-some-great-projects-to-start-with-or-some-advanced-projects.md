You could try to-do lists or e-commerce app to get acquainted with the
CRUD part. One good thing to manipulate Angular is to experiment with
some form of parametric visualization.\
\
Also, one important thing you want to keep in mind if you are doing
project using the MEAN stack or anything equivalent is *deployment*. It
is fairly easy to write an app on your local computer, but you should
have your deployment tools ready from your first commit - and a staging
server/VM is often useful as well.\
\
You can do it easily using Mean command
[linnovate/mean](https://github.com/linnovate/mean#hosting-mean)\
or Heroku : [Deploying a MEAN stack app to
Heroku](http://www.tilcode.com/deploying-a-mean-stack-app-to-heroku/)\
or more fancy with Docker/AWS : [Page on
