title: 'What\''s the difference between Etherium and Etherium Classic (ETC)?'

ETC is a fork of ETH that happened after the DAO hack. The ETH community
that was against hard forking to retrieve funds lost during the DAO hack
went on creating ETC.

The token and chain work almost in the same way but differences are
increasing as time go by. ETH is more widely used. ETC is small but
getting more attention these days.

One of the main difference AFAIU is that the ETC community don\'t really
believe in the ability of the Proof of Stake protocol to replace Proof
of Work. A significant amount of work go to PoS in ETH community,
without much results so far. ETC stick to growing PoW to make their
network secure.

ETH is cool (esp dev tooling) but really lacks of proper hardware
support, so maybe ETC has a card to play here.
