    What is the history of the fight between Pierre Bourdieu and Ségolène
    Royal?
---

Not really a fight. It comes from an interview of Bourdieu where he says
that, when Royal was a student at ENA (French top administration
school), she chose the left-wing only for career purposes. What Bourdieu
said is that she may have been closer to the right-wing in thoughts and
education but career-wise the socialist party was a better choice for
her.\
\
This is actually pretty common, despite the supposed left/right
ideological distinction. One of the main reason of the current success
of National Front in France is because they are having an easy time
recruiting because career in traditional parties are blocked by sarkozy
or hollande crews.\
