After all time I have spent learning about publishing tools, I think I have finally found some approach that fits how I write. Before getting into more writing, let's get this out of the way. Here are a description of the complete stack and workflow I use to write.

## Markdown

I usually write in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). My experience of writing documentation for tech projects and using website generators (see below) have lead me to believe that Markdown is one current satisfactory evolution of writing. Much more portable than word processors like Word or Google Docs. Markdown retains plain text that *includes* the basic formatting such as italic / bold / title / lists. I love to separate the content from the form but these are part of the writing themselves/

## Static websites

Jekyll, Metalsmith, Hugo, etc.. I have tried them all. For each new project, I will usually create a basic website that takes markdown text and layout files to output plain html pages that can be store on some server. Last decade was about blogging system and Wordpress but you quickly get tired of indefinite spam fighting. Plus, all comments are happening on social networks so you really just need a page with text and some styling. I love to experiment with new formats, and that is what we are trying now with @rejon and  [Scale](https://scale.qihardware.org).

## Languages

I often ask myself why I don't write more in French. French is my mother tongue and a powerful language to describe the world. Part of the reason is that I mostly read in English and speak in Chinese. I use French a lot in my daily interactions - I live in France - and will use it occasionally for commissioned writings but it is not my language of predilection for work. One problem is of course that my written English still somehow broken, despite my best efforts to improve it. Grammar and style checkers can be quite useful, especially if you pay attention and learn from your mistakes.

## Writing apps

I write on any text editor that supports Markdown. I usually just open my coding IDE and type into it, so I can benefit from features like multi-line editing and other developer sweets. Colouring, autocomplete, encoding, folder trees: coding IDE have tons of helpers that are useful for software but easily gets in the way of developing ideas. The simpler the better, so I end up using any minimal text editor. I am writing this on Simplenote because it syncs with my mobile so I can proofread or take some notes for the next article elsewhere later on. I write quite a lot on mobile but it is often exhausting for arms and thumbs. Usually feels much easier to read on the phone and write on a computer.

Now that we have the whole kit, let's [sit and write]().
