Recently, I decided to take back control over my previous writings.

Over the years, I have started some blogs, posted things on social networks, but never really thought about what it meant for me and how I should own it. Few weeks ago I decided it was about time to consolidate things I wrote over the course of the years in a single place. Partly because everyday makes me hate more these big Internet platforms, partly because I wanted to have a good look at them, partly to try how to do it - check the [instructions](https://github.com/clemsos/writings).

I pulled all texts back into a [safe harbor](https://clementrenaud.com/writings). Some are still missing but I was already able to see different things. First, quantity. these are A LOT of words. Second, duration. I have been writing online for more than 10 years. Third, frequency. Despite obvious surges during boring summer vacation days, I wrote
relatively consistently during all that time. Current holes in the earliest periods should be filled by more blog posts and article I still need to import.

Taking back control over my writings leads me to discover that I actually may qualify as a *writer*, i.e. someone who writes. Even though it may not sounds like much, I consider it to be quite an impressive title which I didn't expect to be worth of. Over the years, I have spent so much attention to the tools and how they are used that I mostly think I wasn't using them. This is partly because I tends to be more of the instinctive type and don't strategise so much about building up capacity on this or that. With writing scattered in 10s of different networks and blogs, I always thought I failed to act on writing.

Writing about writing exists as a way to prevent myself from committing to the real important task: get all these things I have learnt out of my brain. Managing the cognitive load that goes with all the crazy experiments of this last decade become more challenging by the day. Looking back at all these writings over the years, I didn't even start to scratch the surface of all things I have put down and out there.

The other day I was discussing with my old friend [Theo Pillault](http://theopillault.com) about his experience of as a daily reporter for a newspaper. It occurs to me quite recently that back then he had to ship an article every day. In comparison, I struggled to actually write a single page while overthinking publishing tools. My "writer toolkit" has been ready for years. What was lacking is the right motivation to act. Just sit and write.

Pull back my writing from social networks has lead me to realise how much important work I put into this big platforms while mostly ignoring it. Of course, those networks have helped to meet other great writers and readers but they prevent me from considering the aggregated value of my work. I am glad I took back control and tends to keep it that way. I will keep using social media for different things and still asking myself about deleting all my content while just keeping an active profile.

As the Web gets more and more obscure and closed by the day, we should be reminded of what we contribute to it and why.
