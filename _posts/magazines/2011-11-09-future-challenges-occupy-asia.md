Having followed the OWS movement since its beginnings, what I find
really interesting is all the different ways of appropriation that
people come up with. As Jay Sown said recently in [a
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9zkQcLi4Yo):  *"\[OWS\] is just
specific enough to capture the basic sentiment that so many people
share, and just vague enough to let many different people come to it
with many different shades of meaning".*

The *[Occupy
Central](http://www.mansonkin.com/2009/01/blog-post_31.html)*movement in
Hong Kong arose because people took the OWS model as an opportunity to
express their own problems and ideas -- from very local level concerns
to the biggest globalized issues.

Mobilization in Hong Kong -- the biggest marketplace in Asia -- has been
fuelled by many different layers of political and social concerns: from
housing to racism etc. *"There are so many social problems in HK"*
[said](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/21/hong-kong-why-occupy-central/)
a group of HK students in their letter to the *Occupy Central* movement.
The direct links between Wall Street and its Asian sister, between Hong
Kong's biggest financial institution and the most critical social
issues, have been articulated in the collective dynamics of *Occupy
Central*.

On the mainland, Chinese academics and activists have also called for
globalization of the movement from its very beginning, with a [letter of
support](http://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class16/201110/265482.html)
published on October 2nd and since signed by many people and activists
in China. The [first
protest](http://chinastudygroup.net/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-protests-in-greater-china/)
had been held in Zhenzhou 2 weeks previously yet with a slightly
different agenda as it was essentially organized by old Maoists. Classic
Maoist rhetoric has found a good opportunity for a revival in the OWS,
with many new anti-capitalist topics appearing online. Competition
between China and the US has also led to the public following of OWS by
Chinese mainstream media. Tencent, one of the biggest Internet content
providers in China, has opened [a dedicated
page](http://view.news.qq.com/zt2011/occupywallst/index.htm) for
analysis of OWS, which explains that OWS is not evil but rather proof of
US failure -- i.e. when compared to China. Yet the many different voices
that make up the debate on OWS in China don't really sound coherent and
it's sometimes [difficult to
understand](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2011/10/wall-street-protests-from-china.html)
what it is all really about.

From my personal point of view, one important aspect that has led many
Chinese to become interested in the OWS movement is directly related to
nationalism. The idea that US citizens are rising up to protect and
change their own country has been saluted and has led to many
discussions about China's own future. Some of my friends have even
compared OWS to the
[May](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1750_mayfourth.htm)
4th movement started in China in 1919 by a student uprising after
Shandong Province was given to the Japanese by the Versailles Treaty.
It led to massive protests throughout the whole country. Considered as a
turning point in Chinese history, the May 4th movement turned dissent in
China from a debate for the elite to a mass movement, and made the
people a new factor of change in the politics of the country.

Even if the similarities between OWS and the May 4th movement are not
immediately obvious, at least both movements share an ability to bring
in many different social layers to express their issues together and
bring the people back to the political game.

OWS and its emulators are today providing a worldwide platform for
people everywhere to discuss their own problems in their own words on a
global scale.
