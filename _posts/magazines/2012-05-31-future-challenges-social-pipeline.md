**Digging tunnels under networks**
----------------------------------

I have been spending too much time posting and reposting information
through the many social networks. Digging into Facebook, Twitter,
Google+, Identi.ca, and these days, Pinterest and  Quora --  all very
immersive experiences into human communities. What's more,  Chinese
netizens'  irresistible sense of humour which is producing high-quality
memes on remote social networks like Weibo and Douban, makes you end up
with a "social minute" that eventually lasts for an entire day chatting
and juggling with your web accounts. That is why services  such as
*[*Ifttt*](http://ifttt.com/ "http://ifttt.com/")(If this then that)* or
Facebook activity feeds have created a new solution: interlock all
online services and activities into a *social pipeline*. In 2008, the
Chinese blogger [Isaac
Mao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Mao "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Mao")
was
already [describing](http://www.isaacmao.com/meta/2008/02/micropipeline-as-unblockable.html "http://www.isaacmao.com/meta/2008/02/micropipeline-as-unblockable.html")
this "*micropipeline"* as an *"unblockable infrastructure"* in the fight
against online censorship :

> "*Chinese bloggers are now becoming smarter in building more complex
> personal pipelines to avoid single point failure."*

What used to be little islets within the wild network are now linked
together, slowly merging our different activities on the Web into a
single online identity. Anticipating global tendencies, the gurus of
 the WWW are even conceiving a project
called [WebID](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID), where any person or
organization can be identified with a unique ID. As information
production increases, fact-checks and source verification become crucial
elements.

> *"The ability to enable* *information* sharing (shareability)  will be
> the baseline for the design of many web products in the next years.
> The first important thing is to find a reliable mechanism
> for *certification.*" as Isaac Mao
> [remarked](http://wp.isaacmao.com/2011/06/29/ifttt-%E4%B8%8E%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%AF%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E2%80%9Dshareable-service%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7/ "http://wp.isaacmao.com/2011/06/29/ifttt-%E4%B8%8E%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%AF%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E2%80%9Dshareable-service%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7/")

**Show me your web ID**
-----------------------

Similar to human migrations, the web also quickly grows its checkpoints,
borders, customs and other verification tools to monitor netizen
identities. In China, real ID authentication is required to register any
website or hosting, even to access a cybercafe. Following recent
scandals, the microblog service *Sina Weibo* has
[updated](http://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/05/09/sina-weibo-to-introduce-user-contract-on-may-28-as-chinas-microblog-crackdown-continues/)its
terms of  use and made it mandatory now to show ID to register an
account. The big internet companies in China are all monitoring content
and deleting unverified accounts, especially if they contain
"sensitive" information :

> "*Sometimes the system asks for a phone number to verify the ID of the
> account owner*, but I just skip the procedure and keep on posting." ,
> explains Chinese media activist Wen Yunchao. *"Yesterday Sina Weibo
> once more closed one of my accounts. As usual, I had to register for
> another one. I've done it already more than 25 times."*

But Sina is not only down on people with fake identities, they are also
promoting people who have registered their real identity. Ingrid
Fischer-Schreiber [tells](https://plus.google.com/106685408291386246029/posts/ZYkokKmBiSM "https://plus.google.com/106685408291386246029/posts/ZYkokKmBiSM")
her own incredible story:

> *"I had 500 followers when my account was not yet verified. After
> having been verified, I got 4,500 followers within less than a day.
>  \[One month later\] Inow have 33,600+ followers.﻿ Crazy.*"

**The right to disguise**
-------------------------

Facebook and Google have also adopted a  *real name*
[policy](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/why-facebook-and-googles-concept-of-real-names-is-revolutionary/243171/ "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/why-facebook-and-googles-concept-of-real-names-is-revolutionary/243171/"). The
Chinese columnist Michael Anti got his Facebook account deleted
altogether because he was using his writer's name. Upset by this loss,
he
[challenged](https://twitter.com/#!/mranti/status/45030799975788545 "https://twitter.com/#!/mranti/status/45030799975788545")
the limits of  the policy  :

> *"Am I more fake than [Zuckerberg's
> dog](http://www.facebook.com/beast.the.dog "http://www.facebook.com/beast.the.dog")?"*

This verification process is answering pressure from political and
marketing teams concerned about faking identity. We should remember the
young Fouad Mourtada who [was
jailed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouad_Mourtada_affair) in 2008 for
creating a fake Facebook profile of the King' of Morroco's brother.  At
the same time, this control process is also a requirement of the users
themselves, as Thomas Crampton insists  [in his recent
post](http://www.thomascrampton.com/china/online-dating-china-evan-osnos "http://www.thomascrampton.com/china/online-dating-china-evan-osnos")
:

> *"A key aspect of online dating involves ensuring authenticity."*

At the same time, modern web browsers also reflect our needs for
an intimate browsing experience, mostly offering
an [incognito](https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95464&p=cpn_incognito)
mode. We should now face our own contradictions in building a remote
system of identity which limits our private sphere while adding social
value. Maybe we shouldn't consider data only as our personal property,
but more as a process implying new forms of common ownership. It is now
time to take into account that our avatars are first and foremost social
constructions.
