    What is the most appropriate way for an outsider to approach university
    professors?

Read about their research and ask them a (precise) question about it -
researchers usually love to talk about what they do. Also you can send a
description of an idea for a research you want to realize and ask for
advice (readings, papers, similar research, etc.)
