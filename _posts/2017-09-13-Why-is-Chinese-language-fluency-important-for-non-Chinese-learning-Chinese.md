    Why is Chinese language fluency important for non-Chinese learning
    Chinese?
---

Usually, the first important reason to be fluent is to talk to Chinese
people. You want to have a conversation in Chinese with your clients,
univ professors or this pretty girl down the street. Once you master
fluency, it shows that you have pretty good language skills and, as Paul
mentions, that you can make strong commitment to tackle something
difficult (like learning Chinese).

Then, I see a second reason. I make a difference between the talking
fluency and what I will call "listening fluency". You learn Chinese
because you are willing to understand what is happening with China and
the Chinese, that is to *listen* and pay attention to what people have
to say.

Of course, the second is much rarer. I thought for a long time that
learning a language, eating the food and travelling around was enough to
understand another culture. Now, I think the contrary. Some people just
need ways to access what they need. Being fluent does not prevent you to
be largely ignorant about what is happening to the people you talk to.
