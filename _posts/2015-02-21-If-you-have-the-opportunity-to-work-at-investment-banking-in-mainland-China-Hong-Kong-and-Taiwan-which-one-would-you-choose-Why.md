    If you have the opportunity to work at investment banking in mainland
    China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, which one would you choose? Why?
---

I will chose mainland China because it will allow me to learn a lot more
and gain much more experience quickly. Investment banking in Hong Kong
is just business as usual, sort of very common and risk averse
activity.Life will be easier and sweeter in HK but I will end up being
just one in the million person working in traditional investment
banking. The job will be the job - until the next financial crisis. It
may be an interesting career but not really an exciting one.\
\
On the other side, working in the mainland may be messy. There is a
clear lack of proper regulations or defined processes. The ways to
handle usual things will differ largely so if may push me far away from
my comfort zone. I may have to create and invent many things from
scratch, understand and solve tricky issues and sometimes get out of
complicated situations. That will be more challenging and tiring but at
the end of the day I will have gain very valuable practical knowledge,
made an interesting network and tons of inedit experience.\
\
So I will chose the mainland to start my career because it offer so much
better opportunity for the future. And I will chose HK if I am already
used to the western ways of doing business and want to keep learning at
a slower pace.
