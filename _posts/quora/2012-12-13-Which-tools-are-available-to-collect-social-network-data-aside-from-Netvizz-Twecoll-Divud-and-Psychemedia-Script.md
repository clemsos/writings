    Which tools are available to collect social network data, aside from
    Netvizz, Twecoll, Divud, and Psychemedia Script?
---

I am using a Node server and [hyve](https://github.com/Tawlk/hyve/).js
library to collect data from different social networks. Then you can
store it in a mongoDB for example. 
 
One very good thing about Hyve.js is that the guys from Tawlk have
created a clever USMF United Social Media Format to help you dealing
with tons of different APIs. 
 
I wrote a post about that here : [USMF : One format to rule them
all](http://sharismlab.com/blog/2012/11/16/usmf-one-format-to-rule-them-all/)
