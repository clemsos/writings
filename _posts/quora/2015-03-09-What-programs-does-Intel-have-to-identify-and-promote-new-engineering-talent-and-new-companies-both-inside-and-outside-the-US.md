    What programs does Intel have to identify and promote new engineering
    talent and new companies, both inside and outside the US?

One important program run by Intel is the [Creators
Project](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/about). It is not targeted
towards engineers though. The focus is on art and experiments : bring
together "the next generation of innovators working in indie film,
futuristic architecture, avant-garde electronica and fashion". Intel
started this in 2010 with Vice Magazine and it has hosted great projects
since. 
 
In China, Intel has also started to open  "hacker centers " (创客中心)
to train engineering students on their technology. Their open-source
compatible products Galileo and Edison are used as teaching materials.
The first Intel university lab in China is in Sinan Jiaotong University
in Chengdu.
