title: 'What makes China\''s influencer community different from the US?'
---

The influencers in China (*wanghong)* are more diverse than the ones in
the West. The scope of topics is very broad and goes way beyond
fashionistas and food reviews. Some influencers address an audience that
simply does not exist on social media in the West. Some managed to reach
for people way outside of their original communities. Many are making
big money.

A good example of an untypical audience is elderly people. They have a
lot of time on their hands, want to keep in touch with their relatives
and therefore use Wechat intensively. I have friends on my Wechat that
are over 80 years old (they are the best). They share articles, gifs and
videos all day. Most of these things come from big influencers. They buy
A LOT of things recommended by them - mostly longevity products.

Another example is urban-rural connection. Many young urban Chinese come
from small cities or villages. Very often, they feel isolated in big
cities and miss their home. Some people have figured out they could
exploit that urban homesickness to earn money by broadcasting their
daily life in the countryside. It happens that one of the main channel
for influencers in China is real time video (*zhibo).* The micropayment
system on most Chinese platforms allow users to send money in the form
of various gifts during the broadcast, generating good streams of
revenue. Many influencers channels have also grown their own line of
"lifestyle" products.

The *wanghong* business is very large in China. I live in France and if
you pay attention it is not rare to see influencers coming for a
shooting or a live broadcast with an entire staff.
