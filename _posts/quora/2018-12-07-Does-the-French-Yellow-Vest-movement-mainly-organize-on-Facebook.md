title: 'Does the French  ''Yellow Vest '' movement mainly organize on Facebook?'

There are lots of different public and private Facebook discussions
groups on the topic. Demonstrations have Facebook events and many
leaders use Facebook live to voice their opinions. Not sure if FB is the
main channel for organising this movement but it is an important one for
sure.
