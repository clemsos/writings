    In what ways are Chinese social trends and behavior ahead of US social
    trends and behavior?

Social media in China are already largely made of leisure content
(entertainment, food, etc.) mostly created by a few big content
providers. 
 
Looking at Twitter, Facebook - and Quora, I think social media worldwide
are following the path of other media before (radio, TV, cinema ...) :
large streams of entertaining content for the masses made by a very
structured and profitable industry. 
 
In this regard, I think Chinese social media is ahead and have already
turn into a real *content* industry, not only some web services with
advertisement. I can explain this by several reasons : 

-   The social media industry is run by content providers : Tencent &
    Sina have large news portals and create lots of content.
-   Censorship of the web has forced the industry to turn more and more
    towards entertainment, as  "news " can be more sensitive and risky -
    and therefore generate additional costs.
-   The Chinese social media users tends to follow more brands and
    stars, which naturally brings a bigger focus on entertainment
    content.
