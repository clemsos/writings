title: 'How long will it take mainland China to absorb Hong Kong?'

What do you mean absorb? Countries don 't absorb cities. Real life is
more complicated than that.

Hong Kong is one of the cities in the Pearl River Delta that benefits
from a special administrative status - Macau and Shenzhen are the others
two. As the population in the delta is growing, cities are becoming more
integrated with one another, forming a vast conurbation. Each pole of
this urban system has different functions, that are evolving over time.
According to these evolutions, administrative status will need to change
as well, even though there is still no clear public plan about how it
will happen.

Hong Kong still have many strategic advantages, mostly inherited from
the British trade (International population, common law, banking
industry, etc). The fear of being "absorbed" is somehow symptomatic of
the absence of reflection about the future as a region. The PRD is
likely to be one of the most influential area in the world for the
decades to come. Which role should the city and culture of Hong Kong
play in this project? And how? That is the question that should be
asked.
