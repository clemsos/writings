    How is Baidu Trends (百度预测-大数据 知天下) different from Google
    Trends?
---

On Baidu trends, it seems that you can not look up specific words but
instead there is an interface for indicators realted to different topics
: business, health, sports, etc. On Google trends, you can input a word
and see how much people have been searching it.
