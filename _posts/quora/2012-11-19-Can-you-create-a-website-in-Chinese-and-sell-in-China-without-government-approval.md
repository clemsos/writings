    Can you create a website in Chinese and sell in China without government
    approval?
---

Yes, totally. As long as you host your website outside China, language
doesn\'t matter.\
\
Then if you want something like a .cn domain name or a proper host in a
Chinese data center, you will have to go through the registration
process which includes signing papers in a dedicated police office,
giving all details about your company and activities, provide the ID of
a person in charge, etc.)

Another thing is that if you want to sell things in China, most of
Chinese people use [支付宝 Alipay](http://alipay.com) (from Alibaba). So
you will have to open an Alipay account which is not possible for
foreigners within the Mainland. You can find some companies that
provides gateway though.
