    How would you visualize interactive graphs on a webpage with a time
    scale (nodes, edges disappearing depending on time)? Is there a
    framework for this? Currently I 'm considering D3 or sigma.JS, but I
    can 't really find examples for these.

I have developed an open-source tool exactly for that purpose :
[http://topogram.io](https://topogram.io)

You can download it or use the online version. Also if you have
questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
