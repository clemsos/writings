    Why do many Google employees protest Project Dragonfly on moral and
    censorship grounds; don 't they understand that Google is a for-profit
    business?

With such bad name, I am starting to wonder if "Project Dragonfly" is
not some Google team building strategy to make their employees feel good
about themselves. Nobody believes in the *"Don't be evil"* motto when
the company says it, so having employees to fight over it is useful PR.

At the individual level, it looks like a very cheap way to feel a hero.
People sleep better when they think they are fighting for some greater
cause - especially when they are removed from any real danger.

All in all it looks like Google is really good at preventing their
employees from interacting with the real world. This may explain why
they are not aware about the implications of making the money used to
pay them.
