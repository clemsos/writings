    Are there any special ways to learn to differentiate between the four
    Mandarin tones?

Actually, don 't focus too much on showing tones one by one. It is
important that she grasps the basic fact that there is 4 tones (+ a none
tone), then you can move to real use. Make simple sentences and repeat
it with her. I found words are easier to identify as part of complete
sentences. Tones become more obvious by contrast with others. Also there
is a sort of logic to tones after some time that I never get when
someone will explain it to me but I have been able to grasp it by
imitation. No need to analyze tones too much, that comes with practice
and time only.
