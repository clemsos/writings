The compilation *Rapattitude 2* gather a selection of the greatest songs
and artistsfrom the 90s in France : [Rapattitude, the
tracklist](http://rapattitude2012.skyrock.com/3080248995-Rapattitude-le-tracklisting.html) 
 
There have been a big wave of commercial rap in the last decade with
artists like Rhoff and the Mafia K '1 Fri crew or Booba (biggest rap
sales in France). I don 't like it much but it is worth listening. I
find more underground artists like Casey or La Caution way more creative
and interesting. 
 
If you want to know more, an awesome read is [Abcdr du Son, le magazine
rap](http://www.abcdrduson.com/) . Also, a good friend does a small
publication that have lots of good stuff : [Rapporteuz du
Hip-Hop](http://www.rapporteuz.fr/) 
 
Enjoy !
