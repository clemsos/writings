Regarding other answers about ATM limitations : it doesn 't apply to
foreign cards. I am travelling here now and I got cash easily from ATM
several times in Athens during the last 5 days. Same for other people I
know. 
 
The place is absolutely gorgeous, food is great, people are nice, life
is vibrant and tourists are very welcome. 
Enjoy your stay !
