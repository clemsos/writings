    Will Greater Bay Area erase border, legal system, politics, and economic
    system between HK, Macau and China?

No. It is much more effective and interesting to have four different
legal and financial systems available than just a single one. Each
solves its own set of problems.

Therefore, political borders will remain in the delta even though their
form and nature will change, at least in the foreseeable future.
