    How has the Chinese government 's regulation of Internet content
    affected the business models for Chinese Internet companies?
---

In China, regulations on content are very strict. Broadcasting news or
personal information is considered state business. As the Weibo case
shown, relying on eyeballs and viral content is a bad idea in China.
Government's involvement will only increase as your user base grow, and
that will make your investors and clients very unhappy. Only a handful
of heavily regulated companies can afford this.

For US Internet companies, most business models evolved from media and
creative industries. In China, early discourses about Internet by Jiang
Zemin and his son framed Internet as a public infrastructure emanating
from the telecom industry. It was never really introduced as a "media".

The ad-based models did not fit with China's market political
constraints and regulations, so companies focused on having customers
instead of users. Tencent started in the 2000s to charge users, and back
then even issued its own currency (QCoin) to sell custom avatars and
online games services. Today, it has grown from a chat application to
one of the largest bank and payment processor on earth.

To sum it up, I will say that most companies in China had to rely more
heavily on sales because they could not afford the political costs of
doing business in the media sector.
