Get up at 6am, eat noodles, go to school, do some gym, attend class, eat
rice and fried chicken, drink tea with milk, chat on the phone, share
and comment stuff online, attend more classes, watch movies on your
phone, go to granny 's place, do homework, send and share more stuff on
your phone, have some rehearsal and extra classes like maths or piano,
watch stuff online, sleep.
