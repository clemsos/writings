    Why the photo I posted in full image on sina Weibo turns out to be not
    as clear as it should be?

To avoid large images (especially photos from mobiles), most websites
will resize your image on-the-fly when you post it.

The idea is that they don't want to store and force users to download
large images (usually  <500k) so they modify it to have an appropriate
size (likely  >200k). That is why quality appear downgraded once you
have uploaded it.

It is not specific to Weibo, most websites do that
