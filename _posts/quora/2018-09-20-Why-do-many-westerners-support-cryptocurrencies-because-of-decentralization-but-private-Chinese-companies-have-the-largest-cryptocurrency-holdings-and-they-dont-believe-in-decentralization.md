    Why do many westerners support cryptocurrencies because of
    decentralization, but private Chinese companies have the largest
    cryptocurrency holdings, and they don 't believe in decentralization?

Because most people in BTC or crypto does not even realise who these
Chinese companies are, what is their role, let apart how they function
and why they are in this game. To be fair, these companies are not
exactly the easiest to decypher neither.

Most people in crypto are there for the money so it gets in line pretty
well with why Chinese companies like Bitmain or Canaan are operating.
Decentralisation and immutability are just money-making features really.
The idealists are very few and they usually believe so hard into their
things that they see any efforts as good for "the cause". Meanwhile, the
manufacturers in Beijing are piling up cash quietly. These different
people live in parallel realities that intersect exactly where money is
at. The rest is gossips and marketing sold as ideology.
