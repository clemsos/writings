    What is Alibaba\'s strategy to surpass Amazon globally in the coming
    years?
---

Whatever Amazon is doing, Alibaba's strategy still the same : being an
essential actor of China's infrastructure for present and future growth.

This started with export, commerce, payment, cloud computing, and has
now extended to entertainment, finance, insurance, health, and some
others.

To surpass Amazon is not part of Alibaba's strategy, even though I am
sure they would love to achieve this goal.
