title: 'Why do the French tolerate grocery store closures on Sunday?'
---

I think we tolerate it because it is not so bad to have one day a week
without buying some stuff and queuing at the cashier. 
 
Very few people actually go to church. Personally, I go to the market to
buy fresh  vegetables, meet friends and neighbors, have a coffee in a
little cafe and take time to take the (slow) beat of the place I live. 
 
Then I just cook, eat some good food and spend some time with my friends
and family. 
 
Do I really need to go to a supermarket then?
