    What are five significant advantages China and the Chinese Communist
    Party have over the west?

**Authority** As said below, decisions can be enforced without long
processes and debates. (If this is an advantage right now, it is also a
great danger for CCP) 
 
**Means of production** are available there. Not only   "cheap labour "
and  "lots of people " but also actual factories, international
distribution channels, shipment, etc. China can produce and deliver
virtually anything, like nowhere else. 
 
**Media under control.** This is major advantage for CCP on the short
run, then it can become a threat quickly. That is why some sort of media
like Weibo actually *exists,* to give a sense of relief to civil
society. CCP will have forbid it but people need some way to talk about
their discontents. 
 
**Common wound.** This is crucial. People in China has the sense of a
common pain from the past that they need to overcome. Everyone is ok
with the fact that past decades where crap and now it takes unified
efforts to solve this.
