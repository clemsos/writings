    Why doesn't Shenzhen have an attractive university for both Chinese and
    foreigners?
---

Early age of the city, and also so much to learn already in Shenzhen
outside universities.

Many international universities have been opening campuses in Shenzhen
during the last years : Qinghua, Parsons New School, HK City U, HK
Chinese U, etc. Most of them does not offer full curriculums but only
Master degree and graduate/research programs. The content is often very
innovative, sometimes even experimental, and there is for sure very
interesting things going on here.

Shenzhen can offer unique learning opportunities and will become more
attractive for international students as time goes on. Most programs are
just too early stage right now.
