    Why do China watchers pay so much attention to the front page of
    People 's Daily?
---

That is a tradition inherited from the time of the Soviet Union. There
were people in universities, state services and embassy in the West
doing daily press reviews. The state official daily newspaper was one of
the only source of information. The game was to look at who was featured
on the front page picture and who was missing to guess what was going on
inside the Kremlin.

It is also true that People 's Daily is one of the main communication
tool of the Beijing government. The Chinese central gov mostly states
what he will be doing beforehand so you can just read the newspaper to
know what 's coming. Usually works.

It may also be because their understanding of Chinese language is
limited so they barely look past the front page.
