    in Paris?

She ends up in Beaucaire, a small village which the mayor from her party
was elected last year. As
[Yves](http://quora.com/profile/Yves-Granger)mentioned, she wasn 't
invited as a political representative in Paris and looking at the crowd,
she wouldn 't have been welcome anyway. Plus, the cartoonists at Charlie
Hebdo have made so much fun about her and her father that I don 't know
how she could decently attend.
