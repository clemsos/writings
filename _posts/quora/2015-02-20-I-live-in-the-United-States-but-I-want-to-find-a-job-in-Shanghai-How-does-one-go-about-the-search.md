    I live in the United States, but I want to find a job in Shanghai. How
    does one go about the search?

If visa is not an issue, then just buy a plane ticket and go there. More
than going straight to Shanghai, I will advice you to go around China
for a month or so to see a little bit what the rest of the country looks
like. Then, once you know some basic Chinese words and have a first
understanding of the general situation, just go to Shanghai. There you
can attend events (look on [meetup](http://meetup.com)), meet tons of
people and you should find something quickly. The city is booming and
there is tons of interesting opportunities there but as [Nicholas
Krapels](http://quora.com/profile/Nicholas-Krapels) said : you need to
be in Shanghai first.

Good luck and enjoy. 
Shanghai is a fantastic city !
