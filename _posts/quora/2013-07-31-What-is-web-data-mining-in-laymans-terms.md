title: 'What is web data mining in layman ''s terms?'
---

Think about the web as a big dump of data (web pages, posts, images,
etc.). Then the mining is the attempt to recycle all those pieces of
information into something that makes sense. 
 
It is often used to analyze complicated online trends and events, as the
recollection and organization of those pieces can lead to special
insights. 
 
It is called mining because people tends to describe the process as an
 "extraction " of meaning or value from pretty much random content.
