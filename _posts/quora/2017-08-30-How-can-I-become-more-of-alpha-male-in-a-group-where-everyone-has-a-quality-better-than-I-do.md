    How can I become more of alpha male in a group where everyone has a
    quality better than I do?

The most useful quality you can develop is patience. Just wait until all
the "alpha" males from the group start trying to dominate each other.
Find a safe space. Buy some pop-corn. Watch the fight. Wait more. There
is no group to be part of anymore. You can go on with your life.
