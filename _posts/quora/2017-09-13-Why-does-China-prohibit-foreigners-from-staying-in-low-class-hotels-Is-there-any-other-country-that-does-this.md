    Why does China prohibit foreigners from staying in  'low class ' hotels?
    Is there any other country that does this?

No law forbids it. The law is that you have to registered at the police
station within 24h of arrival in any place in China. Hotel do this
registration for you. The problem is that in some places, having
foreigners staying is highly unusual. So whenever a hotel accept a
foreigner, it will show in the gov system which may come and check the
hotel.

Nobody wants officials checking his business so some hotels just refuse
all foreigners. This is not only true for hotels. It is the same problem
when you stay at friend's. Some don't want you to stay at their house or
will tell you not to register because your presence can bring troubles.

Hotels even very 'low-class' that operate in places like downtown
Shanghai will accept you because you are just one foreigner in a million
and city gov of jingan or huangpu don't give a d * * * about you.
