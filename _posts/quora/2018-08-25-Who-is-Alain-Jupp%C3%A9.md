title: 'Who is Alain Juppé?'
---

Alain Juppé is a French political animal. He has a formidable ability to
survive generations of politicians. He has the reputation of a reliable
and quiet conservative politician, with extensive experience at the
highest levels of the state.

Trained as an administrator and tax inspector, he was Chirac's fidel
lieutenant in charge of the financials. As a loyal soldier, he took a
bullet for him during a case[ [1 ]](#LBMUn) which lead him to lose the
mayor office in Bordeaux, his political fief. He spent a year in exile
in Montreal and reappeared to be immediately reelected in Bordeaux. When
Sarkozy got elected, first thing he did was to give Juppé a "super
ministry" to prepare new industrial and fiscal reforms.

His last battle to date was during the primary for the presidential
elections, which he lost to Fillon. In a classic move, he joined the
ranks of Macron after his defeat.
