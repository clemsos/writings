    What\'s your view on EU Chamber of Commerce\'s statement that Xi\'s
    repetition of opening, without sufficient concrete measures or timelines
    being introduced, has left the European biz community increasingly
    desensitized to these kinds of promises?

The statement shows how out of touch the EU leaders are. Even the US has
stopped promoting free trade but the EU keeps this ridiculous discourse
about "opening up to business".

Everything is on sales in Europe. You can buy a whole street somewhere
nice in France or Portugal for the price of an appartement in Beijing.
Plus, the entire point of law in Europe is to protect land owners
against any possible turmoils. This means that to prevent agressive
property acquisition from foreign investors, one will have to scrap and
amend entire parts of land ownership laws. Good luck with that! So
everything of value is slowly but surely bought by all kind of people
coming from all kind of places : US pensions, emirs, Chinese
princelings, etc.

The EU is whining for reciprocity because they are giving away all their
bargaining power for a stupid ideology that they invented a century ago
to rip off the entire world. Too bad they still didn't notice that "free
market" only works when you are the most powerful in the game...
