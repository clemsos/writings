title: 'Why is China a manufacturing hub?'
---

For decades, Mao was obsessed with China's industrial growth.

After 1980, his successor Deng made possible for factories from any
countries to relocate to China. He also initiated gigantic
infrastructure works to support his plan.

Low taxes and cheap labor drove massive amounts of investments and
factories.

Fast-forward today, all these resources helped to build a gigantic
industrial capacity, making China the first manufacturing hub on the
planet.
