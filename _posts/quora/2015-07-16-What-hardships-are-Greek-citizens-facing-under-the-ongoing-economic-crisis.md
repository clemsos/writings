    What hardships are Greek citizens facing under the ongoing economic
    crisis?
---

More than the economic crisis itself, many greeks have suffered from the
consequences of austerity measures during the last years. One of the
main consequences of austerity policies has been to lower the price of
real estate and land, attracting massive buyouts from foreign companies,
which has lead to large land grabbing and expropriation in rural areas. 
 
The emblematic project by the precedent government (before Syriza) has
been the cession in 2013 of the exploitation rights of Chalkidiki 's
gold mine located in the northern mountain Kavakos to a Canadian mining
corporation (Eldorado Gold) for only 11 millions euros.
