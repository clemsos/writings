Google is a company and its only goal is to expand its business.

The administrative costs and PR risks of working with the US Military is
higher than the money it may generate. Create more problems, make less
money.

On the other hand, complying to Beijing's rules means entering the
Chinese market and instantly get access to almost one billion of new
customers.

Google is more than ready to happily do anything Beijing will ask on any
possible day - like Apple did before. Their current problem is that
Beijing does not want to work with them, despite them trying very hard.
