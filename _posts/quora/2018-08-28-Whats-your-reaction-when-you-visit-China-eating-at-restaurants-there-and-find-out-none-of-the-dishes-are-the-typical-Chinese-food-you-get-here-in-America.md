    What 's your reaction when you visit China, eating at restaurants there
    and find out none of the dishes are the typical Chinese food you get
    here in America?

"Finally, some real food."

One reason is that because the famous dishes mostly come from Southern
China. If you are in the North or Middle/West, they may not be easy to
find.
