    What is the best place to meet Internet tech startup people such as VCs,
    entrepreneurs, or people working at startups in Beijing and Shanghai?

You should try a coworking space called People Squared in Shanghai. They
have a space near Jing An Temple that they share with a hackerspace
(Xinchejian) and a fablab (Xinfab). Another of their space has a cafe
(Xincafe). Look also for Tekyzu events, always a lot of fun and nice
people to meet there.
