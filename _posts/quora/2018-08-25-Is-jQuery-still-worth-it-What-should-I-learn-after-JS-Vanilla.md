title: 'Is jQuery still worth it? What should I learn after JS Vanilla?'

jQuery was made to add interaction to web pages but is not useful to
build modern Web applications. It is a good tool for websites, but if
you want to be more serious you may want to try something like React to
buil frontend apps or d3js for data visualisation.
