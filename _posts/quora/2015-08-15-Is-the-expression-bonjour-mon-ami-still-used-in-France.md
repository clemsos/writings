title: 'Is the expression  ''bonjour mon ami '' still used in France?'

Calling each other  "mon ami " is not very common today,  but I may use
it with some very close friend. It is quite formal and dated tough, but
sometimes you want that kind of feeling, to emphasize that we are like
family. A more informal way which I like is  "bonjour mon vieux ".
