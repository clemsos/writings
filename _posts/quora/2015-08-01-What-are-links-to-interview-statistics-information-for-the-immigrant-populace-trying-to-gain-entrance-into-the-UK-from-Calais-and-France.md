    What are links to interview statistics/information for the immigrant
    populace trying to gain entrance into the UK from Calais and France?
---

Sadly, reliable information about the situation in Calais is very hard
to find. Associations like Medecins Sans Frontieres have been asking to
the gov to launch an official investigation for years.\
\
Last year, the French Interior Minister Bertrand Cazeneuve finally
commissioned a research \[1\]. It contains some background information
about the situation like stats, maps, etc but the overall methodology is
weak - no interviews or sayings by the migrants themselves - ans
conclusions are flawed - no long-term vision, just small fixes.\
\
To get a grasp about the situation on the ground, you can check those
articles (in French) :\

-   [\"Welcome to Calais\" Les migrants dans l'attente du
    Royaume-Uni](http://mappemonde.mgm.fr/num22/lieux/lieux09201.html)\
-   [Le trou noir de
    Calais](http://www.vice.com/fr/read/le-trou-noir-de-calais) ou [24
    heures à Calais](https://news.vice.com/fr/article/24-heures-calais)

    migrants](http://blog.mondediplo.net/2013-05-09-A-Calais-la-France-dans-le-deni-des-migrants)

Also this website (in English)

\
Finally, if you want to talk to people there, you should try to contact
the associations providing support to the migrants in Calais :\

-   *La Platforme de service des migrants* : A federation of many small
    local associations helping migrants 
    <http://www.psmigrants.org/site/>
-   *L\'auberge des migrants :* A group of people that organize daily
    food donations near the Channel <http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr>

\
Then the best way is just to go there and witness. Be ready tough.
Seeing people in misery tracked down by cops in the woods is an absolute
horror vision.\
