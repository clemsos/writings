    Why are millennials becoming artists? Doesn\'t the world need more
    scientists?
---

The world needs more artists. Science needs artists to generate new
questions and representations to explore. Scientists tends to think that
life is about knowledge, but what really drives humans is emotions. The
scientific world today is overfocused on performance and evaluation. It
does not creates, it just optimizes. Humans need to build the future,
not just survive.
