    Why is France 's President Macron talking tough about China when he is
    facing so many problems in French society and in the EU?

He is not - see @[Robin
Daverman](http://quora.com/profile/Robin-Daverman) s answer.

He is just upset with Italy because he thinks they should have consult
with France and Germany before joining BRI. That is the unwritten rule
of the EU: Southern and Eastern countries needs validation from France
and Germany for all major strategic decisions. The "strategic error"
Macron is talking about is a European one, even though it involves
China.

On a side note, it is amazing to see how little energy it took Beijing
to take advantage of the divide between European countries. I am sure
Chinese leaders are very excited to get premium access to these little
fragmented, old and rich euro markets! Will Italy start buying Chinese
trains because they are cheaper than the French and German ones? How
ridiculous....

Really, the European Union economical policies are such a disaster that
there is zero solidarity left, even between our neighbours. China can
not be blamed here - such a juicy move. Macron is just showing how few
power he actually holds by trying to appear presidential and express
some anger but the direction is all wrong.
